1,col1,5/4/70,Columbia University ,"Statement by Andrew M. Cordier, President of Columbia University, Concerning the Extension of American Military Involvement in Southeast Asia",Message,Political CT,"I join with millions of Americans, including students and faculty on this campus, in expressing shock over further American involvement in the Vietnam war through the extension of military activity into Cambodia and the renewed bombing of North Vietnam. These steps were described as necessary to provide for the continued withdrawal of American men, but this argument is contradicted by past experience. In fact, these steps are more likely to lead to still further American involvement in the conflict as well as an increase in the number of participating parties. Although military victory has not been explicitly stated as the end objective of American action in Vietnam, it is clear from the character of the steps taken that this is the goal being pursued. But this objective is untenable. We must of course make a moral judgment about any military action we undertake and in addition to this we should not forget that the older concepts of military victory, and of the fruits of victory belong to societies of the past. This is particularly true in heterogeneous societies, like Vietnam, cursed by deep and bitter social divisions and lacking the benefits of well-developed social and political institutions. If territorial advantage gained at some point in the military effort is to be preserved, it must be followed by decades of costly and unpopular occupation. Such occupation is self-defeating since it shores up artificially the strength of weak regimes and in fact delays the ultimate time when a nation must stand on its own feet and build indigenous institutions to insure the stability and progress of the country. Thus, a long-range view of Vietnam's predictable future, at least as related to external military aid, leads to the conclusion that the American military effort in Vietnam is and will remain futile. It is a quagmire from which we should free ourselves. The conflict is for the Vietnamese a disaster, and the expenditure of American lives and resources in that conflict is totally unwarranted. Our men must be brought home. The squandering of their lives in Vietnam and Cambodia must stop. The massive resources used day by day in support of American military involvement should be redirected with all possible speed to support major programs in our own crisis- ridden cities. Vast changes are taking place both in domestic and in world society. It is a matter of elemental wisdom to respond intelligently to these changes and in fact to anticipate them. In world society we shall find ourselves frustrated and defeated unless we respond on a broad front to the peaceful challenges that exist in that society. Here the soil is rich for the achievement of a new and justifiable national pride different from the national pride based on military achievement which we have seen over the last 190 years. We should as a nation make clear that we join in a common cause with an ever-widening circle of other nations in the pursuit of a wide and enlarged range of peaceful objectives including the economic, social, and educational advancement of all peoples, and therefore of their political stability. The world is yearning for this acceptance by America of a vibrant and effective role in the world community. In turn, America's engagement in this role would make her more effective in alleviating the tensions of international disputes. I crave for our country a full understanding of our prospects for leadership and partnership, and a wholehearted acceptance by our government and people of these objectives. Such multilateral participation in non-military objectives stands in strong contrast to our largely unilateral military efforts in Vietnam. When our nation withdrew from the Geneva conference on Vietnam in 1954, we began to follow a course of action that has never been reversed and which has from the outset weakened those cooperative international diplomatic efforts that could have been marshaled to avoid the tragic consequences of the Vietnam War. For generations Americans have believed that we could achieve anything to which we directed our interest and attention. This is a fantasy. While our resources are great, they are not unlimited. It is therefore a matter of extreme necessity for us to shape our priorities, and direct a much larger share of our resources into domestic areas where acute problems are in fact becoming steadily worse. In a nation that has become largely urban, the problems associated with our cities become more severe. New housing is not keeping pace either with increasing population or as replacement for obsolete housing. If equal opportunity for minority groups is to become a reality, massive financial support will be required. The problem of unemployment, particularly the training of great numbers of people for effective employment, is a matter of deep national concern. To make our homes and streets safe for our people, more resources must be devoted to the causes and prevention of crime. The tragic increase in drug abuse requires careful scientific study, effective law enforcement, and therapeutic programs far beyond their present scope. Education at all levels from the kindergarten to our graduate schools, in urban communities and in rural areas, will require much greater support. These and other matters of profound concern to the American people call for greatly increased public funds. Resources now committed to our intervention in Vietnam and Cambodia should be redirected. The extension of American military operations into Cambodia reveals once more how difficult it is to contain such military conflict and the ease with which it can be extended. It has been previously the stated aim to quickly seek out the enemy in his protected sanctuary and destroy his headquarters, but this goal has proved elusive. From the beginning this has been an unconventional war, marked by unfixed battle fronts and sporadic and frequently accidental occasions of conflict. Under these circumstances the presence of American troops in Cambodia is likely to be prolonged beyond the proclaimed intentions. If so more lives will be lost, more resources will be dissipated and further involvements will be risked. It is necessary that we express our views on this vital concern to the American people and at the highest levels in the Federal Government. I hope that all of us who feel strongly about ending this tragic war will act in such a way as to honor our goal and hasten its fulfillment. I believe millions of Americans, many quietly and in their own ways, share our concern.

Cordier,Message,Social CT,"The action taken today by some of our black students should not obscure the fact that the University has made great progress this year in establishing an Afro-American (black studies) program to be initiated at the beginning of the next academic year. We have indicated to the black students on many occasions in past months that we plan to develop a program of which the University family, including the black students, may well be proud. We are pursuing that course and shall continue to do so. Since last fall our deans and admission personnel, in collaboration with black students, have carried on an extensive program of minority-student recruitment in more than a half dozen large Eastern cities. Black students have visited these cities; interviewing high school seniors, and have been supported in their efforts by University funds. The result of these and other efforts can be seen in the substantial increase of applications and acceptances of black students for next year. Last year Columbia College made offers of admission to 58 black students. For the new academic year beginning next September, double that number -- 115 --black students have been offered admittance as well as 30 Hispanic students. (Last year's figure for Hispanic students is not available). For many months attention has been directed by the President, the Deans, black and white professors, the black students, and parties off campus interested in black etudies. in the development of a curriculum on Afro-American studies. Plans for such a program are well advanced and new courses, which will be a part of the total program, will be initiated at the beginning of the next academic year. As far as assistance to minority students, including blacks and Puerto Ricans, is concerned, additional scholarship money is being sought to add to funds already available so that a larger number of minority students will find it possible to pursue their education. A number of Martin Luther King scholarships will be set up, available to needy students, but principally black and Puerto Rican students. As to the black students in Columbia College, an estimated 95 per cent receive scholarship aid from Columbia, as contrasted with the overall figure of 44 per cent for all students at the College. The average scholarship grant, exclusive of loans and part time jobs, is nearly $1,000 a year higher for black students than for all others. A special training program is being arranged for the summer months to expedite the preparation of those black and Puerto Rican students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to take on. the regular College courses. Since last fall I have urged Deans and Chairmen of Departments to engage in special efforts to increase minority representation on the faculty. It is in fact the policy of the University to increase minority representation on all levels of University life. The pursuit of this program is not a matter of expediency, but a matter of right and justice.

While we deplore such demonstrations, we wish that last night's activities could have ended there. Unfortunately they didn't. After the clearing of Hamilton Hall mob action developed with a reported 1,000 people ranging through the campus in uncontrolled violence. Reports as of early this morning indicate extensive damage in seven buildings, consisting mainly of broken windows and the results of fires set by the demonstrators. The broken windows were caused by the throwing of over 100 bricks which had been dug out of campus walkways. At least some of the fires were set by burning manuscripts and other valuable -- perhaps irreplaceable --papers taken from professors' offices. While there were many other reprehensible actions that could be listed, we cite only this additional one -- our reports indicate that a potted tree was dragged 20 yards across a terrace and dropped on a police vehicle parked in an interior court almost 100 feet below. In case there remains any doubt in anyone's mind about the motivation behind last night's actions, the Strike Committee's statement this morning clearly demonstrates that theirs is a political action -- one that goes far beyond their grievances with the University. When they called for citywide support, and when they asked for risings on other university campuses throughout the country, they showed the true nature of their objectives. The fundamental reason why the University's officials were compelled, on April 30, to call in the police to clear the demonstrators from the occupied buildings was that the overwhelming majority of our faculty and students were being forcibly prevented by a small minority from pursuing their normal academic activities. The infinitely precious academic freedoms of both faculty members and students cannot be exercised if the University is subjected to further riotous demonstrations, occupations of buildings, and violence and wanton vandalism of the kind that occurred on this campus last night. During the past weeks all of us in the University have made every effort to avoid imposing drastic penalties that would permanently remove a large number of students from this community. But all who are genuinely concerned about academic freedom and the rights of students to learn and professors to teach must now see that the University is compelled to use all measures necessary to restore peace in the face of continuing and expanding violence. The essential activities that constitute the life of this and every other university -- teaching, discussions among faculty and students, scholarly and scientific investigation -- cannot be carried on in an atmosphere of actual or threatened violence. There may have been some disbelief on the part of some of the rebellious students that the University would ever discipline large numbers of students.

4,col4,5/5/68,Columbia University ,Face the Nation,Press,Political CT,"Yes, I would do it again because there is no alternative -- there seems to me to be available no alternative except that of complete capitulation to the demands of those who had illegally occupied four of our buildings and in a fifth building all of my own offices. Actually, I think, we ignored no opportunity for negotiation. If I had not felt that there was a possible opportunity for negotiation we would have asked the police to help us clear these buildings much sooner. We began on a basis of negotiation with the students who were the groups of students who were in these respective buildings. We undertook, through the use of administrative officers, to see what could be done. We then used people from the outside, we used faculty members, representing a faculty ad hoc group, who went in and out of the buildings and talked to the students. At no time was there any moderation in any of the students' demands and so, eventually, we were driven to the conclusion that the students wished no negotiated arrangement but wished either complete capitulation or the use of force to eject them from the buildings, which would also arouse widespread sympathy for them in many circles. I would have lost a great deal more faculty sentiment and a great deal of sentiment throughout the country on the ground that we had resorted prematurely to the use of force and had not exhausted the possibilities of negotiation. It was a problem in our thinking because of the fact that Hamilton Hall, after the first night, was exclusively occupied by black students who were almost totally dissociated from the SDS students who were occupying the other buildings. There was no problem -- if I may say so, there was no problem because at Hamilton Hall, unlike the situation in the other buildings, these students behaved themselves like gentlemen. Hamilton Hall was well taken care of. There was no internal vandalism. And we had indications, when our final negotiations which were at about midnight before the decision of calling in of the police, that the Hamilton Hall people rejecter final efforts at negotiation. They indicated to us that, while they wished to be arrested, they would not resist arrest except for being carried out. Consequently the problem really didn't arise in the same way. I think this is due more to the lack of receptivity on the part of the others to efforts at negotiation than to any deliberate desire on our part to have greater violence in one area than another. That evening, of course, we had to begin this, we had to begin plans for this about twelve hours before. We worked with the highest police officers in the city. We had magnificent cooperation from them. We assured them that our problem was not to produce arrests but to empty the buildings. We, of course, prepared a legal warning which was read by university representatives over a bullhorn asking people to leave, indicating that if they left voluntarily they would not be charged with criminal trespass and that their only resistance to eviction. Obviously, in a large operation of this kind, things do perhaps at times tend to get out of hand. If, as I am told, many bystanders and spectators were injured or were arrested or otherwise involved, I am deeply apologetic about it. It was not our plan. It was not our plan at all. And to return to your other question, I was not on campus because Dr. Truman, the Provost and Vice President of the University, and I were specifically requested by the police not to do so. Of course, these are two things and, in the first case, where you are talking about the dropping of criminal charges, obviously, we mist make a distinction between the students and the non-students. About 26 per cent of those who were arrested were non-students. For those who resisted arrest the complainant is the policeman and not the university. That is entirely out of our hands. And the question remains of whether and to what extent the trustees will wish to press or to drop the criminal trespass charges against the other students. This is a matter of which I am sure that they will wish to dis-cuss. It is not a matter within my power to determine. The decision has not yet been made. That's a very complex question and I don't think you can give a simple response to it. Certainly some students wish and expressed themselves about their desire to have a greater share, honestly to have a greater share in the making of university regulations that affected their student life. We had moved pretty far in this direction, we were preparing to move further. We have been negotiating for some weeks about No. But I must insist upon the fact that some of these student leaders are interested only in that kind of reform that will destroy the American university and the American college as we have known it in the past. I would say that some students are of that kind and -- that some students feel this way and constructive developments can be used and developed, that for other students I would disagree. This is, of course, a very good question. There is a limit beyond which the trustees could not divest themselves of the ultimate authority and control over a private university without changing the charter, which has not been changed since This is a matter about which study is now being made. A faculty group is studying this and a trustee group is studying this and what their results will be I do not know. Obviously changes of some sort ought to develop but not changes made under panic situations. And insofar as faculty and student attitudes about the need for this are concerned, I must observe that I wish some of my faculty colleagues who now are so excited about this had given some indication of concern about it before the crisis erupted. And this is not because of any desire to divide and rule. This is -- such a view is complete nonsense. We have fifteen faculties, we have no place at the university where all of the voting members of all the faculties can be accommodated in a single room. Yes, I do. I think -- I planned to send a telegram to my old friend, Jean Roche, the Rector of the University of Paris, suggesting that he and I form a new club. Yes it is, in part, a youth rebellion. Everyone has said, and I think with good reason, that the generation gap today is wider than any time any of us have known about or have read about. Obviously it is the older generation's fault, to a very considerable degree, in that they have allowed young peoplr to reach young adulthood in the belief that they have no obligation to obey rules and laws except those that please them and this, I think, is very unfortunate. I wouldn't for a moment deny the fact that perhaps we have been overly slow in thinking about necessary, about needed organizational changes. All I have said is that I wished that the students and faculty alike who are now so concerned about these things had indicated that concern at an earlier time. Well, as you were saying earlier, Mr. Agronsky, this is a matter not just confined to the Columbia campus, it is not a matter just confined to American university students. This is a youth matter, a generational gap that affects nearly all Western societies. There is no easy way in which local solutions can effectively contribute in any major way. Well, obviously, as I have said earlier, in view of the new faculty interest in having a share in more policy-making than they have evinced in the past, new devices mist be found to supplement the existing machinery. We have had a university council, of course, and to which elected representatives from each faculty attend, and so on. Obviously, we will have to rethink this. I think it depends upon the area of interest you're talking about. Certainly, they should have and do have a great deal of control over their individual lives, those who live in our residence halls, they should have over all things affecting student welfare. I am old-fashioned enough to believe that it is important that the governance of an institution of this kind remain, insofar as decision-making is concerned, in the hands of those who have been at it for many, many years, faculty and administration, and that the advice of students on such matters should be sought, but that it would be fatal if the student views were to be predominant. I hope one lesson is that other universities will be prepared, if unhappily this should be the case, to face up to the ultimate crisis in the way we did with the decision that order and respect for order must be the guiding control over administration decision-making. When I appointed a three-man committee to prepare the plan of organization for the so-called tripartite, now called joint committee, which is now in operation, it was agreed in this first letter sent to me by the chairman of the three-man committee that the decisions of the proposed tripartite committ. would be binding on all parties, but they added the necessary sentence, ""We recognize, however, the ultimate responsibilities of the President of the University,"" which means that there is real question as to whether the absolute and final delegation of power can be made in such matters away from the trustees and the President. The universities all over the country are disinclined to do this because this is, in some sense, a departure from the normal spirit of a university. I would add that this particular one, concerning the Institute of Defense Analyses, is largely a phony issue in this respect because the university does not – IDA does not contract with the university. It merely uses the opportunity to invite individual scholars to work on special projects. It is phony in the sense that this is not an issue of basic importance. The issue you raised earlier, is far more important. And that is should a university engage itself in contracts of secret research. That is far more important. And I have felt that, and I still feel, that the university should make every effort to avoid this but that if we are told by the appropriate government authorities that we have a certain expertise on our campus not easily available anywhere else for work upon something that is vital to the national security and protection of the United States, it ought to be awfully hard for us to say, sorry, we're not interested."" I recognize this as an exception to the normal university rule and this exception ought to be as minimal as possible. We have very, very little such activity at our university and we are not inclined to have any more unless the situation should be absolutely compelling. Obviously, I must await in terms of decisions about specific disciplinary action upon recommendations to come from this newly-appointed joint committee. I can't simply disregard it in dealing with this problem because it was, in part, for this purpose that I set up such a committee at the request of the faculty at Columbia College and supported by a meeting of the joint faculties. It will be very interesting to see what they do recommend about this. The university traditionally is dedicated to the free exploration of all ideas but a university obviously cannot permit young people to do what these young people did in an attempt to carry out their ideas, which is to cripple and destroy and to wreck the university. There is a difference between discussion and a difference between violence. And I must remind you that the university did not initiate violence when it called in the police when these young people engaged in breaking and entering. One of our men was sent to --two of our security guards were seriously injured. One of the most painful parts of the whole decision-making process involving bringing in the police was the realization that the emotional shock would alienate a great many students and faculty who might not otherwise have been in any way sympathetic with the original objectives of the students who had led this activity or who might not understand what their true objectives were. This was something which there was no way of countering because of the emotional shock abhorrent to all faculty people and to myself as well-- I spent my entire life in a university -- of bringing in the police to do an operation of this kind. Obviously, scars will remain for a long time. I would hope very much that we can return just as quickly as possible to our normal operations, that we may have a breathing time during which we may be able to consider needed long-range organizational changes in a more calm atmosphere than the one that now prevails. I think if I were to resign at the present time, then should have done so long ago before I undertook any of these activities. No. I do not intend to resign. I am appointed by the trustees of the university and I have discussed with them, obviously because of my age, long before this arose, certain plans I had about my retirement. But I am not going to resign under fire because that would be a victory for those who are out to wreck the university and I cannot let down my good friends.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdTID9apTKEye_7GM4jPdpkcVgVBEUA0qOCPuZa-mvc/edit?tab=t.mtgmihhvcwom,Grayson Kirk,Male,6/2/53,5451,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Civil Rights & Vietnam,1/1/64,12/31/73,Private non-religious,New York,NY,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",4,"Yes, I would do it again because there is no alternative -- there seems to me to be available no alternative except that of complete capitulation to the demands of those who had illegally occupied four of our buildings and in a fifth building all of my own offices. Actually, I think, we ignored no opportunity for negotiation. If I had not felt that there was a possible opportunity for negotiation we would have asked the police to help us clear these buildings much sooner. We began on a basis of negotiation with the students who were the groups of students who were in these respective buildings. We undertook, through the use of administrative officers, to see what could be done. We then used people from the outside, we used faculty members, representing a faculty ad hoc group, who went in and out of the buildings and talked to the students. At no time was there any moderation in any of the students' demands and so, eventually, we were driven to the conclusion that the students wished no negotiated arrangement but wished either complete capitulation or the use of force to eject them from the buildings, which would also arouse widespread sympathy for them in many circles. I would have lost a great deal more faculty sentiment and a great deal of sentiment throughout the country on the ground that we had resorted prematurely to the use of force and had not exhausted the possibilities of negotiation. It was a problem in our thinking because of the fact that Hamilton Hall, after the first night, was exclusively occupied by black students who were almost totally dissociated from the SDS students who were occupying the other buildings. There was no problem -- if I may say so, there was no problem because at Hamilton Hall, unlike the situation in the other buildings, these students behaved themselves like gentlemen. Hamilton Hall was well taken care of. There was no internal vandalism. And we had indications, when our final negotiations which were at about midnight before the decision of calling in of the police, that the Hamilton Hall people rejecter final efforts at negotiation. They indicated to us that, while they wished to be arrested, they would not resist arrest except for being carried out. Consequently the problem really didn't arise in the same way. I think this is due more to the lack of receptivity on the part of the others to efforts at negotiation than to any deliberate desire on our part to have greater violence in one area than another. That evening, of course, we had to begin this, we had to begin plans for this about twelve hours before. We worked with the highest police officers in the city. We had magnificent cooperation from them. We assured them that our problem was not to produce arrests but to empty the buildings. We, of course, prepared a legal warning which was read by university representatives over a bullhorn asking people to leave, indicating that if they left voluntarily they would not be charged with criminal trespass and that their only resistance to eviction. Obviously, in a large operation of this kind, things do perhaps at times tend to get out of hand. If, as I am told, many bystanders and spectators were injured or were arrested or otherwise involved, I am deeply apologetic about it. It was not our plan. It was not our plan at all. And to return to your other question, I was not on campus because Dr. Truman, the Provost and Vice President of the University, and I were specifically requested by the police not to do so. Of course, these are two things and, in the first case, where you are talking about the dropping of criminal charges, obviously, we mist make a distinction between the students and the non-students. About 26 per cent of those who were arrested were non-students. For those who resisted arrest the complainant is the policeman and not the university. That is entirely out of our hands. And the question remains of whether and to what extent the trustees will wish to press or to drop the criminal trespass charges against the other students. This is a matter of which I am sure that they will wish to dis-cuss. It is not a matter within my power to determine. The decision has not yet been made. That's a very complex question and I don't think you can give a simple response to it. Certainly some students wish and expressed themselves about their desire to have a greater share, honestly to have a greater share in the making of university regulations that affected their student life. We had moved pretty far in this direction, we were preparing to move further. We have been negotiating for some weeks about No. But I must insist upon the fact that some of these student leaders are interested only in that kind of reform that will destroy the American university and the American college as we have known it in the past. I would say that some students are of that kind and -- that some students feel this way and constructive developments can be used and developed, that for other students I would disagree. This is, of course, a very good question. There is a limit beyond which the trustees could not divest themselves of the ultimate authority and control over a private university without changing the charter, which has not been changed since This is a matter about which study is now being made. A faculty group is studying this and a trustee group is studying this and what their results will be I do not know. Obviously changes of some sort ought to develop but not changes made under panic situations. And insofar as faculty and student attitudes about the need for this are concerned, I must observe that I wish some of my faculty colleagues who now are so excited about this had given some indication of concern about it before the crisis erupted. And this is not because of any desire to divide and rule. This is -- such a view is complete nonsense. We have fifteen faculties, we have no place at the university where all of the voting members of all the faculties can be accommodated in a single room. Yes, I do. I think -- I planned to send a telegram to my old friend, Jean Roche, the Rector of the University of Paris, suggesting that he and I form a new club. Yes it is, in part, a youth rebellion. Everyone has said, and I think with good reason, that the generation gap today is wider than any time any of us have known about or have read about. Obviously it is the older generation's fault, to a very considerable degree, in that they have allowed young peoplr to reach young adulthood in the belief that they have no obligation to obey rules and laws except those that please them and this, I think, is very unfortunate.

Coercion at Columbia, however, has largely come to an end and nearly all of us are grateful for that. I owe this community a debt of admiration and gratitude that transcends expression. Columbia's powerful determination to carry on despite forceful efforts to shut us down was simply extraordinary. Faculty and students endured hardship with scarcely a murmur of objection. Thus we were able to accomplish for ourselves what external assistance could not achieve. In the midst of that crisis I felt that it was necessary to pledge not to use police to end the student strike. I kept that pledge, but it was Columbia's determined effort at self-help which made the difference. I am extremely grateful to the overwhelming majority of faculty and students at the University who would not retreat from Columbia's high academic standards during the strike. We had to deal with some extremely serious problems but we did not seek refuge in the device of diminishing ourselves as a university. It was a remarkable display of courage and determination. We have agreed to a University Senate investigation of the charges leveled against Columbia during the strike. Such charges raise deep concerns among many people who found themselves sympathetic to the strike but who would not permit themselves to use force or coercion.

7,sfd1,6/1/69,Stanford University,Sterling's Statement to Senators,Testimony,Political CT,"I welcome this opportunity to discuss some aspects of the very serious and complex problem of campus dissruptions with you today. This situation is relatively new to institutions which traditionally have sought to resolve problems through rational discourse and thoughtful analysis. Understandably, it has aroused the concern of the American people and their representatives, who have so long respected and supported our system of higher education. At the outset, let me make clear that we are concerned— deeply concerned—with the disruptive acts which have occurred with growing frequency on the nation's college campuses, including Stanford. Our colleges and universities are the keystone of America's educational system, which is vital to our national development and welfare. We must not, we dare not, let our institutions of learning be weakened, divided, or destroyed by attacks, from within or from without, which strike at the fundamental freedoms on which they are based. My own views of how we should approach the problem of campus disruption closely parallel those recently expressed by the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. In its interim report, issued in June, the Commission made four specific recommendations for dealing with student disorder. The report expressed hope these suggestions would ""contribute to constructive thought and action before the beginning of the new academic year in September."" At Stanford, during the past year, we already have made substantial progress almost exactly along the guidelines proposed by the Commission. My statement will summarize what we did to prepare for disorders and how this preparedness helped us deal with the disruptions which later occurred at Stanford. The four suggestions of the Commission, in brief, were these: 1. ""A broad consensus should be achieved among students, faculty, and administrators concerning the permissible methods of presenting ideas, proposals, and grievances, and the consequences of going beyond them. 2. ""Universities should prepare and currently review contingency plans for dealing with campus disorders. Advance plans should be made to determine, insofar as possible, the circumstances under which the university will use campus disciplinary procedures, campus police, court injunctions, other court sanctions, and the civil police. 3. ""Procedures for campus governance and constructive reform should be developed to permit more rapid and effective decision-making. 4. ""Faculty leaders and administrative officers need to make greater efforts to improve communication on campus and with alumni and the general public."" The first of the Commission's recommendations may be the most difficult to achieve. On campus, as in the rest of society, effective governance and discipline depend on a reasonably broad consensus regarding the boundaries of acceptable conduct, as well as appropriate means for considering and achieving change. On campus, perhaps even more than elsewhere in society, it is particularly important to maintain an open climate for discussion, where the most controversial ideas can be expressed and debated. Freedom is the essence of the university. As all of us know, it also is the heart of the democratic process. Its historic importance to the academic community accounts for the reluctance of many persons on campus to impose or support harsh penalties on those found guilty of all but the most seriously disruptive acts. But as acts of disruption have grown, both in frequency and severity, the academic community across the country increasingly has recognized them for what they are—namely, a threat to free inquiry, to the free expression of ideas, and to the very civil liberties long regarded as vital to the campus community. This educational process has been neither quick nor cheap. Education seldom is. Given the natural tendencies of individuals in and around universities to ""think otherwise"" on specific issues, we at Stanford have achieved a remarkable degree of unity among trustees, students, faculty, and alumni on the need to avoid violence in resolving differences of opinion and on the need for firm action when that is required. Overwhelming majorities of these constituencies have made clear their opposition to coercive tactics in several ways: 1) through resolutions and referenda; 2) through comprehensive reform of our campus judicial procedures; 3) through tacit or explicit approval of disciplinary steps taken within the campus community; and 4) through widespread support of resort to civil authority when this has proven necessary. Most of this change has occurred within the past year. A specific contrast in instructive. In May, 1968, a majority of the Stanford faculty voted for amnesty for a group of students then occupying the Old Student Union. A year later, the faculty almost unanimously endorsed our action in calling the police to end a sit-in at one of our principal administrative buildings, Encina Hall. The penalties subsequently imposed by the Stanford Judicial Council —14 suspensions, 48 probations, and fines totalling $3525—constituted the broadest and most severe disciplinary action taken on campus in several decades. 1. Our rules on campus disruptions were adopted after wide consultation with the constituencies involved. Formally endorsed by faculty representatives, the rules apply equally to students, faculty, and staff. 2. The University's new basic framework for rule-making and discipline —the Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968—was formally endorsed by students, faculty, and officers. 3. Individuals chosen by students and by faculty comprise the Stanford Judicial Council. This group has the primary responsibility for recommending appropriate disciplinary sanctions, and these have gained very broad support from all campus constituencies. 4. A small consultative group of faculty members, chosen by their colleagues, provided advice to me throughout the year. This included a continuing, detailed examination of the same enforcement alternatives outlined by the National Commission as well as direct, on-the-spot evaluation of actual and anticipated disruptions on our campus. 5. While Stanford chose to place primary reliance on its own disciplinary procedures, the University never ruled out resort to civil authority. Our representatives consulted with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office for nearly a year on steps to be taken in the event outside assistance was needed. Arrangements were made for faculty observers to accompany police to witness actual events. We felt a faculty presence could exercise a moderating influence on any confrontation and help assure accurate reports of what took place. We found the Sheriff's office unusually cooperative and understanding in this undertaking. Following the police action at Encina, and on the same day, a restraining order was obtained from the court. An injunction was subsequently issued and has proven effective. 6. The campus substantially strengthened its own governmental mechanisms through the creation of a new faculty representative body (The Senate of the Academic Council), the extension of student participation to virtually all university committees, and the creation of new consultative mechanisms involving students, faculty, and trustees (the University Advisory Committee). 7. Internal communication was markedly improved, both through face-to-face meetings and through new publications. Student government leaders, on their own initiative, appointed an alumni advisory group, for example. Professors, staff members, and key students received a greatly expanded weekly report on campus events (the Campus Report) as well as numerous overnight- releases on spot developments through direct, internal channels. In addition to these official actions, increasing numbers of individuals have made their oppositon to coercive tactics clear. More than 30 students, acting as citizens and counter demonstrators, took hundreds of photographs and aided in the identification of individuals involved in the off-campus disruption at Stanford Research Institute's branch facility. Several faculty members, also acting on their own initiative, circulated information on the objectives and tactics advocated by various protest groups. Student volunteers pointed out and criticized specific tactics used to build support for the demonstrations. At the initiative of Stanford faculty members, individual professors from ten California colleges and universities recently met at Stanford to extend this kind of activity on a state-wide basis next fall. These voluntary activities, together with the many official actions listed earlier, all point in the same direction—toward a growing sentiment on campus against disruptive acts. Obviously, these measures can provide no guarantee that such acts will not occur again, but they do provide some assurance that support for disruptive acts can be limited and that internal mechanisms can work. To me, it is clear that the roots of campus disruption lie in the most intractable problems of American society and government. The universities are hit first and hardest because they are not as easily protected as other social institutions. The war, and the many ways in which impatient, idealistic youth see us as falling short of our stated goals and values—these are the roots of the trouble. Certainly it is a mistake to describe the most disruptive students as idealists. But their great weapon is an appeal to the idealism of others. When that appeal fails—as much of the time it does—the small minority of revolutionaries is frustrated, and their influence is substantially blunted. When, as happened this spring at Stanford, the appeal to idealism gets a broad response, the headlines are easily generated and the trouble is not easily ended. Let me make it perfectly clear: We realize there is a small, hard core of militant radicals committed to the destruction of our institutions, including our universities. It would not be too difficult to deal with this group alone. The difficulty arises from the sympathy of a large group of idealists for certain stated objectives of the radicals and the accompanying sensitivity of the idealists to any unfairness or arbitrariness in disciplinary action. The tough problem is to prevent the radicals from expanding their ranks. On more than one occasion, the rapid resort to outside force on a university campus has had extremely unfortunate results. It has driven large numbers of the uncommitted and the moderate to the militants' side and also has created deep divisions within the campus community which will require years to heal. As the National Commission notes: "" . . .there is reason to believe that a primary objective of campus revolutionaries is to provoke the calling of police and the kinds of police conduct that will bring the majority over to their side."" While universities were almost wholly unprepared to handle the threat of disruption when it began, a few short years ago, we are learning. We are beginning to have some successes to offset the many setbacks that have made headlines. We do see a turning point. Moderate students and faculty are showing greater awareness of the threat that disruptive tactics create for an academic community. We at Stanford have tried to prepare for whatever action might be required including police action—rather than trying to pretend it could neVer happen. We have obtained a restraining order and a court injunction. While these procedures are no cure-all, they seem to have been effective: though mentioned publicly as targets for disruption, neither my inauguration as president nor commencement exercises were disturbed this year, causing a local paper to remark that Stanford had an ""old-fashioned commencement weekend."" One of our great concerns now is that the turning point may have come too late—that we may find ourselves the victims of a massive counter-attack from an angry American public, fed up with campus antics across the country and too impatient to bear with us as we continue to work hard to solve these problems for ourselves. Efforts of universities across the country to strengthen their own campus judicial mechanisms will be seriously undermined if withdrawal of federal aid for those found guilty of disruptive acts becomes wholly automatic, regardless of the seriousness of the offense or the extent of punishment. In fact, the riders on appropriations bills so far do more harm than good to the cause of maintaining—or restoring—peace on campus. They offend the classic American instinct to take care of one's own problems. First, they penalize the poor but not the rich. Only when campus sanctions require the separation of an individual from college are the rich and the poor treated equally. In that event, of course, federal aid automatically ends. Second, our experience has been that most campus disrupters are not economically deprived and hence do not receive federal aid. Thus federally imposed sanctions have little effect on hard core leadership. Third, in those relatively few cases where withdrawal of federal aid might force a student otherwise eligible to continue his studies to leave a university, the sanctions strike at the heart of a college's autonomy and independence—at its freedom to determine who is and who is not eligible to be a student. These inequities greatly complicate any effort to build and maintain consensus within the academic community on those rules and sanctions which will effectively curb disruption without violating First Amendment freedoms. The National Commission stated this problem well when it said: ""More than seven million young Americans are enrolled in the nation's colleges and universities; the vast majority neither participate in nor sympathize with campus violence. ""If aid is withdrawn from even a few students in a manner that the campus views as unjust, the result may be to radicalize a much larger number by convincing them that existing governmental institutions are as inhumane as the revolutionaries claim."" We have devoted much time, energy, and effort to developing our own internal judicial and governance procedures in ways which will attract the widest possible support. Having made this effort, we so far have been able to seek assistance when necessary from the courts and civil authorities without destroying that same consensus. We seek to build a university community which honors ideals and rejects coercion. The modern university best serves society when it functions as a center for the free discussion of ideas. It cannot long endure any repression of free thought, whether imposed from within or from without. Nor can it function as an armed camp amid warring social factions.",https://archives.stanforddaily.com/1969/07/03?page=1&section=MODSMD_ARTICLE1,J. E.

This situation is relatively new to institutions which traditionally have sought to resolve problems through rational discourse and thoughtful analysis. Understandably, it has aroused the concern of the American people and their representatives, who have so long respected and supported our system of higher education. At the outset, let me make clear that we are concerned— deeply concerned—with the disruptive acts which have occurred with growing frequency on the nation's college campuses, including Stanford. Our colleges and universities are the keystone of America's educational system, which is vital to our national development and welfare. We must not, we dare not, let our institutions of learning be weakened, divided, or destroyed by attacks, from within or from without, which strike at the fundamental freedoms on which they are based. My own views of how we should approach the problem of campus disruption closely parallel those recently expressed by the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. In its interim report, issued in June, the Commission made four specific recommendations for dealing with student disorder. The report expressed hope these suggestions would ""contribute to constructive thought and action before the beginning of the new academic year in September."" At Stanford, during the past year, we already have made substantial progress almost exactly along the guidelines proposed by the Commission. My statement will summarize what we did to prepare for disorders and how this preparedness helped us deal with the disruptions which later occurred at Stanford. The four suggestions of the Commission, in brief, were these: 1. ""A broad consensus should be achieved among students, faculty, and administrators concerning the permissible methods of presenting ideas, proposals, and grievances, and the consequences of going beyond them. 2. ""Universities should prepare and currently review contingency plans for dealing with campus disorders. Advance plans should be made to determine, insofar as possible, the circumstances under which the university will use campus disciplinary procedures, campus police, court injunctions, other court sanctions, and the civil police. 3. ""Procedures for campus governance and constructive reform should be developed to permit more rapid and effective decision-making. 4. ""Faculty leaders and administrative officers need to make greater efforts to improve communication on campus and with alumni and the general public.""

The students with whom I first discussed the possibility of an S.T.&T. program more than a decade ago thought that such a program might serve a useful purpose. I hope that it still does. The major problems confront ing universities do not change radically from year to year. Ma jor problems have a way of persisting, even among shifts of emphasis. But the spirit and willingness to consider change should always exist. Last year at this Convocation I pointed out that the university as an institu tion has been going through a period of critical review during the past decade and more, and that the range and intensity of this review during the past decade and more, and that the range and intensity of this re view have increase in recent years. This review is by no means confined to the United States. It is happening in na tions, new and old, around the world. . . . It is not surprising that under the pressure of larger enroll ments universities have grown both in number and in size, and that educational budgets have Increased. Nor is it surprising that participation in the solution of social problems has both stimulated and obliged univer sities to re-examine curricula. Still in the context of univer sity, it is important to note that education throughout the world gets its major financial support from public funds —in most coun tries almost entirely so. In only a few countries, such as Japan, the Philippines and the United States, is the private sector of higher education noteworthy, and it is mainly in the United States that institutions in the private sector rival in strength and distinction those in the pub lic sector. The financial dependence of universities upon public funds invariably raises the specter of possible political influence — a specter which has recently ap peared on local horizons. Politi cal influence can be exercised in a variety of ways. It is a func tion of government to determine priorities among national needs, and there is ample evidence, in old countries and now, that the allocation of public funds to edu cation can be influenced by these priorities. Those who are zealous to pre serve the educational indepen dence and self-determination of the university should be alert to risks and dangers involved in ever allowing the university, as university, to become a political instrument or a pawn in the hands of those who would use it as such, be those hands in side or out the university. . . . Prosperity And Interest During the past two decades the United States has been pros perous, and its general public has manifest greater interest in education at all levels. Education has benefited from both the pros perity and the interest. . . . Stanford, like so many of her sister institutions, has been in many ways the beneficiary of this support and interest. In con sequence, there has been change. Since 1950, the student body has increased in size by approxi mately 40 per cent; the regular faculty by 170 per cent. The an nual fiscal operation of the Uni versity, exclusive of improve ments and additions to physical plant, has increased by a factor of 10. The building program has not kept pace with increase in enrollment and faculty. There is less academic space per student today than there was 15 years ago, although substantial gains have been made during the past three years and more are in early prospect. The University's endownment has increased more than four fold, yet the income from it pays for a smaller fraction of an nual operating costs than it did in 1950. Tuition has increased from $600 in 1950, but it too pays a smaller fraction of operating costs today than it did then. The University currently depends on gifts and grants to support about 30 per cent of its annual operating expenditures, and to pay for new buildings and the rehabilitation of old ones. And given the understandable fact that donors have their own pref erences as to the use of their gifts, it follows that their pref erences do not always coincide with what the University regards as its most urgent needs. In other words, the University's priorities of need may be modi fied by the designation of gifts. Two Problems Manifestly, the University has to address itself to problems growing out of this siuation. Let me mention two. One of these problems — one which I men tioned last year—is that of size. It is clear that, despite the gains recently made, we still need more academic space adequately to accommodate our present faculty afid student body. And it would be my hope that we could continue to make gains as a high priority in the faculty student ratio, thereby adding fur ther flexibility and strength to teaching and research. There is pressing need to add to library resources and, as tuition in creases, to amplify student fi nancial aid. If these needs are to be met out of available and anticipated resources, with the objective of improvinb academic quality, serious consideration must be given to the size of the student body, not least of all at the graduate level. Another problem, not unre lated to size, is that of the resi dence university. Stanford be gan as essentially a residence university, and the aspiration to continue as such is woven into a large part of its history. But increase in student numbers, ad ditional mobility provided by the automobile, and the capital cost of new residence halls have com bined to produce a situation in which Stanford is less a resi dence university than it used to be, and to raise the question as to whether the aspiration to be a residence university is viable. I would also recall from the not so-distant past the study of un dergraduate education at Stan ford which was made a decade ago. That study was directed mainly to the possibility and de sirability of curricular change. It resulted, among other things, in the General Studies program; it also led to the development of the overseas campuses for un dergraduates. It is during the de cade since that study was made that Stanford has experienced its major increase in enrollment, particularly at the graduate level, and has approximately doubled the size of its faculty. It is also during that dec&de that the academic potential of the student body has notably in creased. So, as I think you know, an other study is now under way. Last autumn a small planning committee, including the presi dent of the study body and an other student, recommended that the new study be as compre hensive as possible; that it in clude consideration of both grad uate and undergraduate educa tion, both curricular and extra curricular programs; and that it search out opportunities for in novation, flexibility and im provement. Another Study An executive committee of seven or eight persons will be in charge of the study. Professor Herbert Packer, recently ap pointed Vice-Provost for Aca demic Planning and Programs, is Chairman of the committee. The committee will utilize a va riety of task forces or ad hoc committees as needed, so that many faculty, students and of ficers of the University will be involved. It is anticipated that the study will extend through most if not all of the next academic year, but this does not mean that the Committee will recommend no thing until the study is com pleted; rather it is intended that recommendations will flow from the Committee throughout the course of the study. For instance, priority attention will be given to the concept of the residence university and the problsm therein entailed, including the ""Off"" issue, the value of such projects as Grove House, the roles of Tutors, Sponsors and .Resident Associates. It is to be expected, therefore, that during the next eighteen months or so this University community will be broadly and actively engaged in this new study and in con sidertion of the recommenda tions which it produces. And I dare say that one of the major eventual considerations will be this: How can educational re view and improvement be, so to speak, institutionalized and thereby eliminate periodic and, in Professor Parker's phrase, ""somewhat convulsive"" attacks on the problem. University Government If this is to be achieved, at tention must be directed to Uni versity government. This subject needs attention for other reasons as well, including that of size. I have been interested to note in the professional journals on higher education that this sub ject of university government has had increasing attention dur ing the past three or four years. This has come about, as I read the journals, in part because of size—as student enrollments and faculty have increased in num ber—and in part because the need for educational review and 'change calls for mechanisms which will make possible knowl edgeable discussion and delibera tion of educational programs in terms of the resources available to support them. University government stems from the Charter, the legisaltive statute or the constitutional pro vision by which a given institu tion was established. These char ters or statutes vest authority and responsibility in Boards of Trustees, Regents or Governors. From these Boards, subordinate authority and responsibilities are delegate to faculty, students and officers of the institution. This is the established pattern and I do not anticipate that there will be basic change in it at least at an early date. New Mechanisms But it is not of this pattern which I speak when I suggest the need for new mechanisms, because there is opportunity for new mechanisms within the pat tern. For instance, the Board of Trustees of this University has a Committee of its membership presently engaged in a study of the Board's composition and or ganization. The objective is to make more effective use of the very considerable time which Trustees devote to Stanford af fairs, and thereby to keep them still more closely in touch with the academic programs and needs of the University. As Trustee organization is be ing considered, so too might the organization of the faculty and of the student body benefit from re-examination. Given the size of the faculty and of the student body respectively, it is unlikely that the total membership of each can be effectively and reg ularly engaged in deliberations on educational pr ogram and pol icy. For the faculty, this invites the possibility of electing a rep resentative body small enough for constructive discussion and large enough to give adequate voice to the seven Schools. For the students, it invites consider ation of the reorganization of student government if the pres ent organization is judged to be lacking in representation or per formance. For all segments of the University, it invites critical attention to the invention of mechanisms which will improve collaborative effort to advance the University by orderly pro cedures. It would seem to me that the educational review now under way would be incomplete if it did not direct attention to the subject of university govern ment. Suggestions Before each of these Convo cations I have asked students to suggest topics which I might discuss. The suggestion which heads the list this year is this: How can a student best spend his undergraduate years?"" This question is by no means new. I suspect that teachers and counsellors have been hearing that question for generations. I suspect also that answers vary from generation to generation, and that they vary also within any student generation as each student seeks counsel for him self and his individual concerns. In the depressed 1930'5, for in stance, at the surface of concern for most students was how to muster the financial where withal to stay in school, and the question of whether they could get a job upon graduation. They had some preoccupation with economic security. Their interest in public affairs was, as I recall, directed to two main considerations: One related di rectly to the depression and led to the question whether democ racy could cope with the ten sions, the dislocations and the despair which the depression produced, or whether some other form of government could cope more adequately with such problems. . . . The G.l.'s Before the 1930's had passed into history, much of the world was at war. When it was over, tens of thousands of Gl's re sumed their education. They had lost time. They were pre occupied with catching up. They were good students, eager to learn, eager to complete college and to begin a career and a fam ily. This mood persisted into the early 1950'5. There had not been time for the mood to change much between the con clusion of World War II and the outbreak of hostilities in Korea. And the early 1950's included also the sinister and unforget able episode of McCarthyism. These years did not include anything but the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement begin ings which were dramatized by the spotlight on schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. And, with all due respect, the then President of the United States did not have the appeal to youth that he had to older generations— certainly not the appeal to youth which emanated from John Fitzgerald Kennedy. So the students of the 1950's came to be regarded as the ""silent generation,"" and perhaps under standably so. Thus, at different times and in different contexts students have asked the question: How best can a student spend his under graduate years? Students In the 'AO's What of the context in which the students of the 1960's ask this question? I have no expert diagnosis, nor do I know of any, that is unassailable. Nor do I know of any generalization which applies precisely to any individual student. But let me invite your consideration of a few observations. 1. Not one of today's students has personally experienced a major depression or its conse quences. 2. Very few of today's stu dents have had direct experience in war. And none has had ex perience in a war, such as World War 11, in which the motivation to serve was so broadly and na tionally based. The war they know is undeclared and far away; it implements a national policy which they and others question and is administered by a government which does not command their full confidence. 3. The student generation of the late 1950's and the 1960's is the first to live under the threat of nuclear war. I cannot mea sure the impact of that threat, but I should judge from conver sations with many students that many of you are affected by it. Greater Pressure 4. Today's students have been subjected to greater pressures than their predecessors for get ting into the college of their choice—pressures which derive in part from the great increase in national enrollment. They have felt these pressures since age 14 or 15, and find, in col lege, that these pressures con tinue for those who, in increas ing numbers, plan to go on to graduate and professional schools. 5. Partly because our society is affluent and partly because a burst of new knowledge has in vited greater specialization, to today's students, unlike those of the 1930'5, are confronted with multiple choice of opportunity. In the opinion of one observer, the very richness and diversity of opportunity produce a sense of insecurity. What choice should the student make? What if the choice is wrong? 6. I mentioned a moment ago the appeal which President Ken nedy had for youth. For many students, their response to this appeal may be seen in their participation in the Peace Corps, in the Civil Rights movement and in other less publicized en terprizes by which they seek to help the underprivileged. Such participation is for them the deed and not merely the word of idealism. Time For Idealism Youth is peculiarly the time for idealism and not infrequent ly in this generation or others this idealism is coupled with re jectlon. The degree and depth of this rejection are always hard, if not impossible, to mea sure. Today some students seem to reject specialization—they want to be the Renaissance and some, presumably hope for a part, and perhaps this number is greater, reject the value-sys tem of their parents and puzzle themselves as to why this par ticular rejection is not better understood. Hence the so-called generation-gap and, I suppose, a part of the credibility gap. There is, for some, rejection of what they regard as slavishness to conformity—conformity in dress, in conventional manners, and in such things as the am bition to have a house in the suburbs, a two-car family and a colored televsiion within easy reach. I dare say that these observa tions do not embrace the whole context out of which today's students ask the question, ""How best can I spend my undergrad uate years?"" But I suggest that they are significant parts of the whole, The context in which the question is asked varies with time and circumstance, but the question itself is a hardy per ennial. Partial Answer Part of the answer lies within cach of you. You know better than anyone else why you came to college. I take it that you wanted to do so, that few, if any, of you came against your will and only in response to some parental or other pres sure. And you should know bet ter than anyone else why you wanted to come. I should as sume that the basic reason was, of course, to continue your edu cation. The opportunity to do so in a new environment away from home was probably not unappealing to you. The pros pect of enjoying a kind of new freedom had its attractions as well as anxieties. Many, if not most, of you thought of college as a natural, even necessary, next step in preparation for a career. I doubt that you thought of college and a baccalaureate degree simply as a status sym bol. How consciously you looked forward to college as an experi ence in self development I don't know, but it was probably some where in your stream of con sciousness. In any event, you should know better than any one else why you wanted to come to college. How aware were you when you came that knowledge is the most powerful of all human re sources, that there is more knowledge today than ever be fore, and that its rate of accum ulation continues to accelerate. Since knowledge is the most im portant commodity a college or university has to offer, it fol lows that a student's major op portunity is to absorb and col late as much of it as possible so that he may harness and hitch it and put it to work. . . Commitment There is a word in our vocabu lary which I hear many of you use with considerable frequency. It is the word ""commitment."" As I hear you use the word, it is most frequently associated with a sense of urgency to im prove society, including the Uni versity. I delight in this, even though my delight is sometimes punctuated with problems. I de light in it because it bespeaks a concern about the welfare of mankind and a desire to be of service I know of no commit ment which can result in better self development or in greater service to mankind than a com mitment to learn, a commitment to knowledge. And this is the prime commitment which I would urge you to make. The basic purpose of the educational review now under way, in which important contributions are ex pected from you, is to discover better ways and opportunities to acquire knowledge and to put knowledge to work so that bet ter ways may be found to solve problems great and small which beset society. The whole purpose of knowl edge is to liberate—to liberate from ignorance, from perjudice, and from obsolence. There is much knowledge to be discov ered; this, too, is a mission of the university—and probably its most exciting mission. Two Observations Let me conclude with two ob servations and questions. First: As you spend your un dergraduate years, acquiring knowledge in the classrooms, in the library and laboratory, in discussions among yourselves and with others, by participat ing in a variety of activities, in seeking, as we all do, to discover and refine a set of values by which each of us can live a happy and helpful life, please ponder this question: What value a criticism, a conviction or a principle which is not based on knowledge? Second: The vital statistics of this nation indicate that in a few years half of our population will be less than 30 years of age. This prospect should be very en couraging for those of you who accept the cliche that no one over thirty can be trusted. But not for long after those under 30 will have constituted a ma jority, you will join the minor ity. Will you then be knowledge able enough to be trustworthy? I believe that you will, and that knowledge and trustworthi ness will mean much to Stan ford tomorrow, as it does today.",https://archives.stanforddaily.com/1967/01/25?page=5&section=MODSMD_ARTICLE22#article,J.

The students with whom I first discussed the possibility of an S.T.&T. program more than a decade ago thought that such a program might serve a useful purpose. I hope that it still does. The major problems confront ing universities do not change radically from year to year. Ma jor problems have a way of persisting, even among shifts of emphasis. But the spirit and willingness to consider change should always exist. Last year at this Convocation I pointed out that the university as an institu tion has been going through a period of critical review during the past decade and more, and that the range and intensity of this review during the past decade and more, and that the range and intensity of this re view have increase in recent years.

And you should know bet ter than anyone else why you wanted to come. I should as sume that the basic reason was, of course, to continue your edu cation. The opportunity to do so in a new environment away from home was probably not unappealing to you. The pros pect of enjoying a kind of new freedom had its attractions as well as anxieties. Many, if not most, of you thought of college as a natural, even necessary, next step in preparation for a career. I doubt that you thought of college and a baccalaureate degree simply as a status sym bol. How consciously you looked forward to college as an experi ence in self development I don't know, but it was probably some where in your stream of con sciousness. In any event, you should know better than any one else why you wanted to come to college. How aware were you when you came that knowledge is the most powerful of all human re sources, that there is more knowledge today than ever be fore, and that its rate of accum ulation continues to accelerate. Since knowledge is the most im portant commodity a college or university has to offer, it fol lows that a student's major op portunity is to absorb and col late as much of it as possible so that he may harness and hitch it and put it to work. . . Commitment There is a word in our vocabu lary which I hear many of you use with considerable frequency. It is the word ""commitment."" As I hear you use the word, it is most frequently associated with a sense of urgency to im prove society, including the Uni versity. I delight in this, even though my delight is sometimes punctuated with problems. I de light in it because it bespeaks a concern about the welfare of mankind and a desire to be of service I know of no commit ment which can result in better self development or in greater service to mankind than a com mitment to learn, a commitment to knowledge. And this is the prime commitment which I would urge you to make. The basic purpose of the educational review now under way, in which important contributions are ex pected from you, is to discover better ways and opportunities to acquire knowledge and to put knowledge to work so that bet ter ways may be found to solve problems great and small which beset society. The whole purpose of knowl edge is to liberate—to liberate from ignorance, from perjudice, and from obsolence. There is much knowledge to be discov ered; this, too, is a mission of the university—and probably its most exciting mission. Two Observations Let me conclude with two ob servations and questions. First: As you spend your un dergraduate years, acquiring knowledge in the classrooms, in the library and laboratory, in discussions among yourselves and with others, by participat ing in a variety of activities, in seeking, as we all do, to discover and refine a set of values by which each of us can live a happy and helpful life, please ponder this question: What value a criticism, a conviction or a principle which is not based on knowledge? Second: The vital statistics of this nation indicate that in a few years half of our population will be less than 30 years of age. This prospect should be very en couraging for those of you who accept the cliche that no one over thirty can be trusted. But not for long after those under 30 will have constituted a ma jority, you will join the minor ity. Will you then be knowledge able enough to be trustworthy? I believe that you will, and that knowledge and trustworthi ness will mean much to Stan ford tomorrow, as it does today.",3618,0.006985294,0.001838235,0.002573529,0.018014706,0.195955882,0.010661765,0.533455882,0.014338235,0.006985294,0.012132353,0.014338235,0.007720588,0.064338235,0.008455882,0.004044118,0.032720588,0.016544118,0.007720588,0.028308824,0.012867647,0.057720588,0.079779412,0.054411765,0.808088235,1/5/67,"Civil

10,sfd4,5/8/70,Stanford University,Statement on International Activity,Message,Political CT,"In my statement last Sunday, I encouraged schools and departments to guide various activities discussing national and international issues which concern all of us and about which we have deeply held beliefs. I listened over KZSU to some of the teach-ins and other discussions and was greatly impressed by the sincere interest in and penetrating discussion of important problems. There has been a lot of extraordinary education this week. We now face the question of how the University can combine the completion of this year's academic obligations with due attention to the national and international crisis that now weighs upon us all so heavily. Somehow we must accommodate and reconcile the interests of students who wish to study and take degrees, of faculty who wish to pursue important educational objectives, and of all those who, out of conscience and concern for the future of mankind, feel that they must suspend as much as possible their normal activities until the crisis is resolved. Individual schools and departments must work out arrangements that suit their particular circumstances. But some basic principles should be observed that will help preserve Stanford as a genuine university. To this end we must remain heedful of individual rights of faculty and students to teach, learn, and do research. I propose that, for the remainder of this term, we follow an expanded pattern of activities—a ""period of extra commitment."" This will require extra time and effort on the part of the faculty. The exact pattern will vary from school to school and from department to department. The essential features include fulfillment of our basic educational responsibilities together with special opportunities and flexibility for students and faculty to deal with the current crisis. More particularly, I suggest: First, all academic personnel at Stanford remain under obligation to fulfill their academic responsibilities for the remainder of this quarter; in the discharge of their teaching responsibilities, however, they are free to make new arrangements as to schedules and requirements, consistent with their obligations to those students who wish to carry on their academic pursuits. Second, I encourage all teachers at Stanford to carry on additional activities, such as special seminars, discussions, and the kinds of teach-ins that have proven so successful this week. Let us emphasize the need to teach out; perhaps the best example we have of this so far is our Washington delegation. The many primary campaigns now underway across the country provide other opportunities to translate belief into action. Third, where students request incompletes this term, I urge that the faculty grant them without requiring the customary individual justification. Fourth, in order to make it possible for students ot make new arrangements, the date for dropping courses or units in this quarter is advanced from May 13 to the first day of final examinations. It should be clear to all that neither these nor any other constructive arrangements can be made effective for the remainder of this quarter so long as faculty, students, and staff are physically prevented from pursuing their responsibilities.

11,sfd5,2/21/69,Stanford University,Statement to Black Student Union,Message,Social CT,"While Provost Lyman and I welcome discussions with responsible student groups, it is not possible to hold such discussions under conditions of destruction or coercion. We regret very much that a constructive meeting with the BSU leadership this morning was followed by disruptive tactics and destructive acts. It is clearly impossible to continue discussion of substantive issues until a more responsible atmosphere exists. The University has made substantial progress and will continue to move forward in improving educational opportunities as our response to the BSU proposals demonstrates. The following working paper, intended as a basis for further discussion, was presented Thursday to the leaders of the Black Students Union by President Pitzer and other University officers in response to the Feb. 4 demands of the BSU. At a public rally in White Plaza on February 4, 1969, the Black Student Union made public a set of 12 demands having to do with various aspects of programs involving blacks at Stanford. The attached statement responds point-by-point to those demands. Several introductory comments are in order. First, the first of the BSU demands had to do with the allegations against Professor Robert Koff of the 'School of Education. No response to that demand is included here, because the results of that case are now a matter of public record. The Human Relations Commission report on it has been made public, as has the following exchange of correspondence between President Pitzer and Dean James. The School of Education has moved to reorganize the interviewing for the STEP program, and the coordinator of interviewing is now a black man who has been a member of the STEP staff. Second, it should be noted that a number of the demands ask for changes that had already been planned before any demands were made. That is true of at least parts of numbers 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9. Action on these was under way and would have been taken whether or not they had been demanded. This suggests that Stanford is, in fact, moving forward toward greater opportunities for members of minority groups, be they students, faculty, of staff. Even more important, it argues strongly for the proposition that progress can and will be made without confrontation, violence or disruption so long as all elements of the community are willing to join in cooperative efforts towards that end. 2. ""There be a black faculty member in every department by Fall 'eg."" Even if this were to be adopted as a desirable goal, it would be impossible to attain. A recent study of 105 universities (every institution which averages 10 doctorates or more per year) showed that a total of 294 Ph.D.'s were awarded to Black Americans from 1964-68. Further, of the 83 Black recipients in 1967 and 1968, more than 25% were in two fields, Biology and Education. A total of 22 fields were represented, 7 with only one degree in that two-year period. Persons with the standard qualifications simply do not exist to meet the need. The situation is not hopeless. The academic departments are responsible for faculty recruitment, and many have been actively searching for minority group candidates capable of serving on the Stanford faculty. In 1967-68 there was one black member of the Academic Council at Stanford. If present plans materialize, there will be six or more by September 1969. This is an encouraging start. Clearly, however, the full answer to the problem lies in encouraging more black students to choose college teaching as their career and to make the necessary training available. Item 8 speaks to the latter point. A start on the former might be made with undergraduates currently enrolled at Stanford. We would welcome ideas on ways to recruit a larger proportion of our own students into graduate programs that lead to teaching careers. 3. ""The Counseling and Testing Center have five black counselors."" There is clearly a need for additional counseling services for minority students. For the past several months Mr. Simmons and Dean Smith have been working on ways to begin to meet this need and they have been in correspondence with several possible candidates for a position at Stanford. The most critical problem area appears to be financial counseling. We intend, therefore, to add a person to the staff whose duties would include financial counseling of minority students and general counseling as well. Because of this combination of responsibilities he will serve jointly on the staffs of the Financial Aids Office and the Dean of Students. 4. ""Stanford University hire more black people on all levels, and provide more jobs for black high school students, and that all employed as such use the Minority Divisions Office."" To take the second part first, a change in the University's employment procedures is about to be issued which will require that all non-professional job openings be listed with the Personnel Office so that minority applicants will have a fair chance at ail positions normally filled through the Personnel Office. This policy change has been developed over the last 3 months and was discussed at the Dean's Council meeting of January 27. Faculty and professional research positions will, as always, be the responsibility of departments. It is important to have the facts of our present situation clear. In March 1968, there were 223 Blacks and 156 Mexican-Americans employed by Stanford. At the end of November there were 390 Blacks (an increase of 74.9%) and 177 Mexican-Americans (an increase of 13.5%). The two groups combined constitute about 6.5% of all Stanford employees and a considerably larger fraction on non-faculty employees. Many problems remain, particularly in the area of Mexican-American employment, but progress has been and will continue to be made. Finally, with respect to the employment of Black high school students, last summer 152 minority students from nearby communities were employed on Campus. Eighty six of these were formally in the Youth Opportunity Program. The effort to provide part-time jobs during the school year has been less successful; about twenty students are now employed. The sharp reduction in government funds for research has made it difficult for departments and laboratories which want to employ a student to do so. In response to this, the Personnel Office has shifted funds from other uses to keep this program alive. It would be useful to know how the BSU and other groups feel about the importance of this program as compared to such other uses of limited funds as pre-employment training programs or on-the-job training programs. 5. ""No black student work in the Work-Study Program involuntarily, and that their >cholarship be supplemented by a grant instead. Minimum salary of $2.50."" No student is ever required to work in any particular program; rather Work-Study is an opportunity for students who need or desire funds in addition to those which can be provided as grants. It is now the policy of the University to evaluate each student's financial and academic needs on an individual basis and to provide an aid package that tries to account for both sets of needs within the limits of available funds. For 1969-70, $168,800 in additional funds has been allocated for minority student financial aid. Employment is rarely required for a freshman minority student. Beyond that, decisions must be based on the facts of individual cases in consultation with, and with the understanding of the student involved. The demand for a $2.50 per hour minimum wage for work-study jobs cannot be met, although some increases in present stipend levels will be made from time to time. To do so would not result in any student's earning additional money since the government regulations stipulate maximum earning power under the program. Students would, of course earn the maximum in fewer hours, but one result of that would be to put employers who must carry on student performed functions in a difficult position. 6. ""Stanford create jobs and/or give academic credit for students working in East Palo Alto."" We are exploring ways to use Work-Study funds in East Palo Alto. In the interim, students were informed last week that $2,500 is available to pay five of six black students for tutoring at Ravenswood High School. The idea of closer connections between the University and community groups which would permit students to work on community projects is an excellent one. Mr. Simmons will be seeking out these opportunities and will give special attention to the possibility of joint fund-raising efforts to finance this involvement. The question of academic credit properly rests with the University faculty. Individual faculty members and their departments are responsible for designing and approving courses. Courses involving field experiences of various kinds have been and are part of the curriculum. More can be added if faculty are prepared to design and teach them. 7. ""A black man be hired as Assistant to the President in Financial Aids Department and be in charge of all black financial matters."" This is covered under item 3. 8. ""A black man be in charge of all black graduate admissions, acting as coordinator for graduate schools in graduate admissions."" There are two separate problems here, one involving the professional schools and another having to do *ith the graduate programs, mostly in H&S. The former are relatively self-contained and completely autonomous in admissions matters. Business, Law, and Medicine have used their autonomy to develop their own minority recruiting programs. Business and Law each has a person in charge of its efforts; in Medicine, a committee is doing the work. Education has actively ecruited minority students, most notably in the STEP program. The picture is more varied in Engineering, which is more like H&S. Electrical Engineering has been active and effective, other departments somewhat less so. The problem in H&S is that of autonomy among a large number of small units. To illustrate the complexity that this produces, of 15 H&S departments canvassed, 10 have some active concern for attracting minority candidates. The forms of this concern range from active recruitment programs to some kind of special consideration for applicants who can be identified as members of minority groups. The canvass disclosed no cooperative efforts among departments. Each was acting on its own. This suggests that assistance from the Graduate Dean's office in the form of information, assistance in recruitment, and the like, would pay dividends by making more effective the individual department efforts already underway. This kind of assistance will be offered and will be made more systematic than in the past. Admission decisions would, of course, continue to be made by the individual departments. 9. ""A black man be hired as Vice-President of Stanford in charge of all black affairs, answerable only to the President."" Over the past several months it has become clear that the duties of Mr. Simmons and those to be performed by the new Mexican-American appointee can be more effectively carried out from the President's Office rather than from within any one of the vice-presidential areas. Therefore, both positions are to carry the title of Assistant to the President. From the vantage point of the President's Office, Mr. Simmons and his counterpart will have direct and easy access to the President, and the ability to handle problems in any of the vice presidential areas at the request of the President. 10. ""The minority recruitment committee for the Medical School be given full power over minority admissions."" As was indicated in Item 8, this is an issue for the Medical School faculty to decide. 11. ""An Afro-American Studies Department be established at Stanford University."" The new degree-granting major in African and Afro-American Studies was developed by a faculty-student committee. Its form as a program rather than a department represented the committee's best judgment on how to get a solid program started at Stanford. It would at best be premature to overrule that judgment now. It should be noted that the Committee and others are aware that our offerings are strongest in African Studies and significantly weaker in Afro-American studies. The Committee believed that it is valuable to bring together in a more systematic way what is now available and to work toward providing what is not now available. Some courses in the program are new to Stanford this year, including Racism and Prejudice, African Civilizations, the Politics of Minority Groups, and others. New courses will be added next year as faculty are brought to Stanford with competence in relevant fields. In that connection, the University is now negotiating with a major scholar in the field in the hope that he will join the faculty next fall and assume the leadership of the program. A decision on departmental status, in this case as in others, must follow from the development of the program rather than precede it. 12. ""An Afro-American Cultural Research Institute be established at Stanford University."" There is a great need for :esearch and curriculum development in this field."" The University is actively seeking funds for a program developed by Professor Wesley Johnson of History winch would start on both of those and would include PhD and post-doctoral training to provide persons qualified to teach in the field. We believe that this is the most effective approach to take, and we hope that foundations and others will agree.",http://archives.stanforddaily.com/1969/02/21?page=3&section=MODSMD_ARTICLE6#article,Kenneth Pitzer,Male,12/1/68,82,Republican,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Civil Rights & Vietnam,1/1/64,12/31/73,Private non-religious,Stanford,CA,West,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",11,"While Provost Lyman and I welcome discussions with responsible student groups, it is not possible to hold such discussions under conditions of destruction or coercion.

To illustrate the complexity that this produces, of 15 H&S departments canvassed, 10 have some active concern for attracting minority candidates. The forms of this concern range from active recruitment programs to some kind of special consideration for applicants who can be identified as members of minority groups. The canvass disclosed no cooperative efforts among departments. Each was acting on its own. This suggests that assistance from the Graduate Dean's office in the form of information, assistance in recruitment, and the like, would pay dividends by making more effective the individual department efforts already underway. This kind of assistance will be offered and will be made more systematic than in the past. Admission decisions would, of course, continue to be made by the individual departments. 9. ""A black man be hired as Vice-President of Stanford in charge of all black affairs, answerable only to the President."" Over the past several months it has become clear that the duties of Mr. Simmons and those to be performed by the new Mexican-American appointee can be more effectively carried out from the President's Office rather than from within any one of the vice-presidential areas. Therefore, both positions are to carry the title of Assistant to the President. From the vantage point of the President's Office, Mr. Simmons and his counterpart will have direct and easy access to the President, and the ability to handle problems in any of the vice presidential areas at the request of the President. 10. ""The minority recruitment committee for the Medical School be given full power over minority admissions."" As was indicated in Item 8, this is an issue for the Medical School faculty to decide. 11. ""An Afro-American Studies Department be established at Stanford University."" The new degree-granting major in African and Afro-American Studies was developed by a faculty-student committee. Its form as a program rather than a department represented the committee's best judgment on how to get a solid program started at Stanford. It would at best be premature to overrule that judgment now. It should be noted that the Committee and others are aware that our offerings are strongest in African Studies and significantly weaker in Afro-American studies. The Committee believed that it is valuable to bring together in a more systematic way what is now available and to work toward providing what is not now available. Some courses in the program are new to Stanford this year, including Racism and Prejudice, African Civilizations, the Politics of Minority Groups, and others. New courses will be added next year as faculty are brought to Stanford with competence in relevant fields. In that connection, the University is now negotiating with a major scholar in the field in the hope that he will join the faculty next fall and assume the leadership of the program. A decision on departmental status, in this case as in others, must follow from the development of the program rather than precede it. 12. ""An Afro-American Cultural Research Institute be established at Stanford University."" There is a great need for :esearch and curriculum development in this field."" The University is actively seeking funds for a program developed by Professor Wesley Johnson of History winch would start on both of those and would include PhD and post-doctoral training to provide persons qualified to teach in the field. We believe that this is the most effective approach to take, and we hope that foundations and others will agree.",2258,0.113539446,0.006929638,0.002665245,0.013326226,0.142324094,0.007995736,0.002665245,0.041044776,0.045309168,0.341684435,0.117803838,0.009061834,0.03891258,0.012260128,0.012260128,0.028251599,0.006929638,0.048507463,0.005863539,0.002665245,0.209488273,0.04424307,0.068230277,0.67803838,2/21/69,"Civil

15,ksu3,5/9/72,Kent State University,Speech,Remarks,Political CT,"Virtually all constituencies of the University, our many publics, and the media have pressed for some statement concerning President Nixon's speech last night by the President of Kent State University. The volatile response of the campus could be predicted. Indeed, on April 21, I hand delivered to the White House a personal letter to the President, reminding him of my efforts as early as March, 1968, to avert just such an eventuality, my labors at the United Nations during 1969-71 to prevent such escalation, and the intrinsic relation between campus unrest, in 1970 and now, and the war. I urged the halt of the renewed and massive bombing of the North; renewed efforts at negotiation; involvement of the U.N. and the international community in a supervised cease fire and monitored and open election. With the risks now so great, implicating the so-called Great Powers directly, dividing our own nation more deeply, and raising the prospect of major escalation of the war, there should be small wonder that the Universities and their students should be so vocal and dramatic in their concern. They have had the privilege and responsibility of reflection on the issues at stake, the facts of history, the political realities, and the idealogies involved. Many of their members have been to Vietnam and back as Veterans. Indeed, much of the strongest and first hand opposition to the war and its escalation comes from this group. What is deeply needed now, is assurance that the universities' resources of intelligence, competence and commitment be brought to bear on the issues of this war, the grounds and prospects of peace, viable alternatives, and the clarification of relevant action, and not be diverted or perverted into an arena of conflicting passions, disruption and violence or illustration of precisely that kind of irrational or irresponsible behavior that is so reprehensible in the war itself. Should the university succomb to the very methods it protests, in the act of protest, it loses its moral authority to speak, its social relevance to persuade, and deepens ' an already dangerous dychotomy. Concerning the substance of President Nixon's speech of last night and its gravity, I can make only a few brief remarks. My views as a private citizen regarding the war in Vietnam are well known and long standing. They turn on my early criticism of our accepting the mantle of French colonialism as early as 1954; our role in relation to the Geneva accords of that year; our successive involvement in ""Americanizing"" Vietnam; our failure in early and successive involvement of the U.N.; our neglect of the good offices of the Secretary General; our . military and political misreading of events in that tragic country; our support of persons and policies in South Vietnam contradictory of efforts at conciliation, compromise, and negotiation; and the scorched earth policy of strategic bombing. were My efforts in the political campaign of 1968,/rooted in the conviction that Mr. Nixon would and could end the war, reverse these trends, and achieve a negotiated and honorable peace. What is so discouraging to me now, is to see the progressive deterioration of that prospect, and the narrowing of the President's options, and the increased risk of escalation. One is never free at a moment of action. We earn that freedom by anticipation and planning or we are caught by circumstance. I can only assume that a major purpose for President Nixon's trip to China, and his proposed trip to the Soviet Union, was to seek, in any appropriate way, to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement for Vietnam. The President must think in Global terms, and in security matters larger than Vietnam. We have worked for a decade to prepare the Moscow talks for strategic arms limitation, and address the larger question of disarmament. All this is now at stake in the President's decision of last night. One would have to conclude that he had come to this final position on the basis of several assumptions: 1. That his extensive consultation with the Chinese and Soviets convinced him such action would not risk military confrontation at this time; 2.. That such action, implicating both the Soviet and Chinese would signal to the Vietnamese the attitude of their chief suppliers of war material; 3. That failure of the North Vietnarese to grasp the full impact of their refusal to permit the U.S, to negotiate a settle- ment, or withdraw without danger and dishonol, runs this kind of final risk; 4. That though the U.S. is deeply divided on the War, the American people would not accept total collapse and abrogation of an effort, however misguided or gone astray, that initially sought to help a people resist aggression, is had been done in Berlin, Greece, Korea, and elsewhere, and in wich the nagaleude The president proposed he had only 3 alternatives: l. with- drawal: 2. negotiation, and 3. final massive effort to end the war. He indicated for the first time all out withdrawal of American troops in four months, cessation of all use of force, provided an international cease fire is imposed and American prisoners of war are released. In my view these are not exhaustive or exclusive alternatives. The urgency and gravity of the potential risks involved could and should enlist the international community, and especially, the U.N. with the People's Republic of China now a member, in both pressure and good offices to modify each of the alternatives. The fundamental clash and opposition of the North Vietnamese nine points, the Viet Cong 7, the U.S. and South Vietnam 8, and now Mr. Nixon's final two, are not without resolution. International supervision of a cease fire is possible. It served in Palestine, Korea, and still in Cyprus. International supervision of an election is possible. It has been done before. The critical issues still concern the composition of the South Vietnam government, and a date of American troop withdrawal. A neutral team, acceptable to the Soviet Union, China, the U.S., and both Vietnams, could address the final conditions of a negotiated cease fire and settlement. Instrumentality of both secret and public negotiation is at hand. This is the route I would take. It is still open to us. The risks of open and military confrontation with the Soviet Union, the Peoples Republic of China, and further extension of the War in Vietnam is too great. I do not accept that the alternative is either loss of our men or our honor. Pyrrhic victories are no victories. There is no military solution to Vietnam. There is no way to bomb a people into independence. We do not abandon our friends or our servicemen when we seek to resolve the final issues at the negotiating table. The international community can and must place its interest in peace, and its authority and good offices, between these battling brothers, and between the nuclear powers in the name of a common humanity now deeply threatened. The University is no partisan political body. Its freedom, however, is rooted in its social responsibility, as an instrument of reason in a passionate world, an agent of peaceful change in an era of violence. My earnest hope, and deepest prayer is that this university can be just that. It has seen enough senseless killing, the tragedy of violent action, the escalation of innocence, mob action, and bitter defiance, to know this is not the way to go. What made this past week at Kent State so remarkable was the manner in which our students, and faculty, demonstrated the peaceful purpose of a University, kept their moving moral protest of the war and the tragedy of May 4, 1970, constructive, educational, and persuasive, and without violence. Many people of the town, and others off campus, remarked on the impact of the commemorative services, the silent tombstones, the vigils, the dialogue, and the witness of concerned students pressing for change, honoring the rights of others, and the ongoing mission of the University. I am counting on the continuance of this responsible spirit. I will continue to support the constitutional rights of free speech and assembly and peaceable protest. At the same time, I will insure that the exercise of such rights will not infringe on the rights of others, threaten the life or property of another, or disrupt the operation of the University without invoking the full authority of the law. I believe our students understand this; that I intend to be firm and fair in implementing this policy and invite their partnership and responsibility in insuring that no event or assembly escalate into necessity for the use of force.",https://omeka.library.kent.edu/special-collections/files/pdfs/6140.pdf,Glenn Olds,Male,9/17/71,235,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Civil Rights & Vietnam,1/1/64,12/31/73,Public,Kent,OH,Midwest,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",15,"Virtually all constituencies of the University, our many publics, and the media have pressed for some statement concerning President Nixon's speech last night by the President of Kent State University.

My views as a private citizen regarding the war in Vietnam are well known and long standing. They turn on my early criticism of our accepting the mantle of French colonialism as early as 1954; our role in relation to the Geneva accords of that year; our successive involvement in ""Americanizing"" Vietnam; our failure in early and successive involvement of the U.N.; our neglect of the good offices of the Secretary General; our . military and political misreading of events in that tragic country; our support of persons and policies in South Vietnam contradictory of efforts at conciliation, compromise, and negotiation; and the scorched earth policy of strategic bombing. were My efforts in the political campaign of 1968,/rooted in the conviction that Mr. Nixon would and could end the war, reverse these trends, and achieve a negotiated and honorable peace. What is so discouraging to me now, is to see the progressive deterioration of that prospect, and the narrowing of the President's options, and the increased risk of escalation. One is never free at a moment of action. We earn that freedom by anticipation and planning or we are caught by circumstance. I can only assume that a major purpose for President Nixon's trip to China, and his proposed trip to the Soviet Union, was to seek, in any appropriate way, to lay the groundwork for a negotiated settlement for Vietnam. The President must think in Global terms, and in security matters larger than Vietnam. We have worked for a decade to prepare the Moscow talks for strategic arms limitation, and address the larger question of disarmament. All this is now at stake in the President's decision of last night. One would have to conclude that he had come to this final position on the basis of several assumptions: 1. That his extensive consultation with the Chinese and Soviets convinced him such action would not risk military confrontation at this time; 2.. That such action, implicating both the Soviet and Chinese would signal to the Vietnamese the attitude of their chief suppliers of war material; 3. That failure of the North Vietnarese to grasp the full impact of their refusal to permit the U.S, to negotiate a settle- ment, or withdraw without danger and dishonol, runs this kind of final risk; 4. That though the U.S. is deeply divided on the War, the American people would not accept total collapse and abrogation of an effort, however misguided or gone astray, that initially sought to help a people resist aggression, is had been done in Berlin, Greece, Korea, and elsewhere, and in wich the nagaleude The president proposed he had only 3 alternatives: l. with- drawal: 2. negotiation, and 3. final massive effort to end the war. He indicated for the first time all out withdrawal of American troops in four months, cessation of all use of force, provided an international cease fire is imposed and American prisoners of war are released. In my view these are not exhaustive or exclusive alternatives. The urgency and gravity of the potential risks involved could and should enlist the international community, and especially, the U.N. with the People's Republic of China now a member, in both pressure and good offices to modify each of the alternatives. The fundamental clash and opposition of the North Vietnamese nine points, the Viet Cong 7, the U.S. and South Vietnam 8, and now Mr. Nixon's final two, are not without resolution. International supervision of a cease fire is possible. It served in Palestine, Korea, and still in Cyprus. International supervision of an election is possible. It has been done before. The critical issues still concern the composition of the South Vietnam government, and a date of American troop withdrawal. A neutral team, acceptable to the Soviet Union, China, the U.S., and both Vietnams, could address the final conditions of a negotiated cease fire and settlement. Instrumentality of both secret and public negotiation is at hand. This is the route I would take. It is still open to us. The risks of open and military confrontation with the Soviet Union, the Peoples Republic of China, and further extension of the War in Vietnam is too great. I do not accept that the alternative is either loss of our men or our honor. Pyrrhic victories are no victories. There is no military solution to Vietnam. There is no way to bomb a people into independence. We do not abandon our friends or our servicemen when we seek to resolve the final issues at the negotiating table. The international community can and must place its interest in peace, and its authority and good offices, between these battling brothers, and between the nuclear powers in the name of a common humanity now deeply threatened. The University is no partisan political body. Its freedom, however, is rooted in its social responsibility, as an instrument of reason in a passionate world, an agent of peaceful change in an era of violence. My earnest hope, and deepest prayer is that this university can be just that. It has seen enough senseless killing, the tragedy of violent action, the escalation of innocence, mob action, and bitter defiance, to know this is not the way to go. What made this past week at Kent State so remarkable was the manner in which our students, and faculty, demonstrated the peaceful purpose of a University, kept their moving moral protest of the war and the tragedy of May 4, 1970, constructive, educational, and persuasive, and without violence. Many people of the town, and others off campus, remarked on the impact of the commemorative services, the silent tombstones, the vigils, the dialogue, and the witness of concerned students pressing for change, honoring the rights of others, and the ongoing mission of the University. I am counting on the continuance of this responsible spirit. I will continue to support the constitutional rights of free speech and assembly and peaceable protest. At the same time, I will insure that the exercise of such rights will not infringe on the rights of others, threaten the life or property of another, or disrupt the operation of the University without invoking the full authority of the law. I believe our students understand this; that I intend to be firm and fair in implementing this policy and invite their partnership and responsibility in insuring that no event or assembly escalate into necessity for the use of force.",1452,0.08254717,0.073113208,0.030660377,0.05581761,0.025943396,0.008647799,0.046383648,0.024371069,0.014937107,0.011792453,0.016509434,0.027515723,0.014937107,0.041666667,0.018081761,0.038522013,0.016509434,0.378144654,0.043238994,0.030660377,0.613993711,0.076257862,0.113207547,0.196540881,5/9/72,"Civil

22,ucb4,5/1/65,"University of California, Berkeley",One of our problems Martin Meyerson speech,Remarks,Campus CT,"One of our problems at the Berkeley campus is our reputation -- our reputation, hasten to add, for being one of the most stimulating centers of learning anywhere. Students coming to a university with an excellent faculty and excel lent fellow students sometimes expect even more stimulation than exists and are disappointed. In my observation, this is true of all the great universities of the world. Expectations which exceed actualities can produce alienation; alternatively they can be a goad to betterment. That goad exists here. I have never seen a university with more ferment for educational improvement than we now have. Paradoxically, a study recently done by one of our Senate members showed a very high level of satisfaction among students with the education offered to them at Berkeley. Nevertheless in both the fields of letters and sciences and in the professional fields, individual faculty members, groups of faculty members, and whole departments and schools are considering new approaches to higher learning. Some of the questions that are being raised currently are ones which have been discussed many times before on this campus and elsewhere. Other questions are new and arise from changes in the state of our knowledge and our urban civilization. Yet even questions which were once asked and resolved must be asked and resolved again, and then again. Today I wish to raise some, but only some, perplexing questions about educational issues. These questions derive from my statement on education of a few weeks ago. I would like to enlist the aid of the Senate in a search for answers. In that search we must be both del iberative and resolute. We should act soon, before our determination to define ourselves anew weakens. Yet, we must also recognize that questions which affect the very character of our university can never be settled finally since our university, like all great universities, is itself in flux. - 2 - A key question is whether or not there is a body of wisdom which should be common to all educated men and women. Many students and faculty here report the felt lack of such a basis for a community of discourse. We have long since passed by the notion that an educated person is one who has forgotten the Greek and Latin he studied. General Education with a capital G and E has become a most attractive beacon for some who are concerned with colleges and universities and a repellent for others who see no single formula leading to intellectual development. We should discourage the superficial name-dropping characteristic of some general education programs in which students learn to identify a Lucretius, a Buddha, a Bentham or a Freud with a capsule sentence. But should not all our students be exposed to certain central ideas that have dominated man's civilization, Eastern as well as Western? The general education programs started by Robert Hutchins at Chicago, by John Erskine at Columbia at an earl ier time, and more recently at Harvard, have not seemed persuasive to the great state universities with thei r many professional programs. Would it not be better for a unive rsity such as ours to travel many paths rather than the single paths chosen elsewhere to understand man's civili~ zation? For example, it may be more meaningful to some prospective engineers to understand history in terms of man's technology and his reactions to it than to understand it through diplomacy or other views of history. After all, we always use selective lenses to examine the world, and it ought to enrich our view of the world if we develop more rather than fewer lenses. Alternatively, a field can be taught in general terms designed for students from many disciplines: students whose intellectual bond is their ignorance of the field. General education in the natural sciences might fall under this category. Most general education programs have had a humanistic bias and even a bias which concentrated on the past. I have often thought that the natura.1 scientists seem the better educated in the two-cultures controversy because they know science and - 3 - also frequently aTe interes·ted in and knowledgeab-Iein the arts. But it is a rare person in the humanities who is conversant with science. believe that the natural sciences should be central to any effort to achieve a general education. Although I share the disdain of the specialist for those who wish facile paths to a wisdom which is necessarily intricate, I am nevertheless convinced that it should be possible to distill the exciting ideas from specialized fields and to make them accessible to those who are not specialists. This is particularly true for those students (probably the bulk of them) who prefer a general education which stresses the present and the future to one which stresses the past. Although reasonable men may differ, I feel that we do not now achieve the breadth that an educated person should have through our distribution requirements in any of our undergraduate programs. Nor do I think that there is any model of a clearly superior kind of general education -- or for that matter undergraduate education itself -- which wi 11 meet all our needs at Berkeley where students are so diverse not only in their backgrounds but also in their interests and motivations. Ought we not to consider a pluralistic approach to general education? For example, could not more courses, cutting across disciplines be offered by teachers or groups of teachers with the intent of providing that enriching educational experience at which our departmentally oriented breadth requirements now aim? let there be a healthy competition between such general education courses and some of our present courses. As a related question we should ask ourselves, how shall our vast university produce intellectual centers of identification? Because we are so large, we can, as I have suggested at other times, offer a range of choice which smaller institutions cannot. And this choice need not be only in specialized course offerings but also in the organization of knowledge. Thus, for example, if we wish we could provide an undergraduate option on our campus equivalent to that - 4 - provided by St. Johns College at Annapolis. Students and teachers who wish to join together to explore the great texts of man's past, including some of his scientific texts, could do so. Others could choose, as is now being proposed by one of our colleagues, to organize their learning about certain historical periods: Periclean Greece, contemporary America, and so on. For that matter, I can see no reason why we could not even have an Antioch or a Northeastern at Berkeley with those students who wished, taking part in a cooperative work-study program, learning part of the year at the University and part on the job. Engineering already provides such an option. In such a pluralistic approach to education, a student at a St. Johns at Berkeley would have most of the advantages of a small college but also the advantages that only a large institution can provide: great libraries, laboratories and cultural opportunities. Furthermore, a student or faculty member need not be bound forever to a particular educational constellation; he might decide that another option was more appropriate to his interests. These options, programs or centers could, but need not, cut across school and college as well as department lines. They are one way to bridge the atomistic pole of isolated students, teachers and courses and the cosmic pole of the great university. The options would be the intermediaries. The larger university through central facilities and cultural offerings could help provide the cement to hold the intermediaries together. There is a conceivable danger that there may be so many options, programs or centers that no amount of cement could keep the university from being fractured. (Cement can keep the bricks apart as well as join them.) Despite current yearnings for innovation I do not see that danger as real. There is another conceivable danger: that options would only further compl icate an organizational structure which al ready demands a great deal of faculty time to work -- and a great deal of student time to understand. On the other hand, the consideration of options would give another push to simplifying our organizational structure. - 5 - I have not called these options or centers Ilcolleges."" I prefer to think of them as less structured and more tentative. Some may be associated with residence halls, but they need not be. We should also consider whether some should be associated with our research institutes. Though the total budgetary requirements of multiple centers or options may be no greater than present requirements, certain reallocations no doubt would be needed. Departments would have to regard some of the new options as substitutes , for some of their present offerings. I ask the Senate not to embark on implementing my suggestions but to consider them along with the other proposals for educational revitalization which are forthcoming from many quarters on our campus today. Inevitably, proposals for such centers or intermediaries raise the analogy with Oxford and Cambridge. Admiring as I am of these great English universities, I fear that the corporate sense of the Oxbridge Colleges may have impeded the development of new fields of learning. The identification of the Colleges with particular pieces of real estate made them permanent and reluctant to change. What they did teach, they taught well. We must ask ourselves the question of what kind of excellence they encouraged, and also the question of how wise it is to over-concentrate talent: there was one period, for example, when Trinity College, Cambridge, with a few hundred students and teachers had half of Britain1s Nobel Prize winners and all the officers of the Royal Society. The Oxbridge Colleges tend to define excellence in terms of the numbers of First Class Honours the students in each receive. The examining is done by the University and not by those who teach the students being examined, so each College puts forth a great deal of effort to have its students do weI I in central ized schools examinations. But what does a first signify? Is it really more than just mastering the system? At Berkeley, of course, many students complain about exams and grades, - 6 - which are to them only mile-posts In the rat-race. Perhaps their complaints about the rat-race are complaints about the human condition itself, in which time, like other resources, is more I imited than are wants. Incidentally, those students who are most eager to eliminate the grading of students are also most vocal in recommending the grading of the faculty. teachers. It is difficult to grade either students or If examinations are to be a learning experience, the experience should stress synthesis rather than the regurgitation of discrete items of knowledge. We should also consider the wisdom of separating teaching from examining as Chicago and other universities have done. We can examine, of course, without necessari Iy grading. I suspect, however, that students are more competitive than they say they are, and that they would be reluctant to give up what measure of their accomplishments there is in grading. The recently completed review of five years of grades by departments suggests many variations which cannot easily be explained. Why should one department have 4~1o Als and another only ~Io at the lower division level? There may be good reasons in terms of the qual ity of the students or the demands of the field, but then again more capricious reasons, of which we may not be aware, may be in effect. Many of you know my conviction that no member of the faculty should abdicate his responsibilities for grades to teaching assistants or readers. After all, teaching assistants are here to learn how to teach under supervision. Perhaps some should serve as tutors. We must put our own house in order in the rewards we should offer and the demands we should make of teaching assistants. The evaluation of teachers is at least as difficult as the evaluation of students. An analysis of student reactions to teachers shows great differences in the response of the students who themselves get high grades or low grades. Thus in one study at another university, students who received Als seemed to have reactions opposite to those who received (IS. The teacher favored by the ( student was rejected by the A student. .• 7 - Without wanting to minimize the appeal of a teacher to his students, surely we would not wish to evaluate faculty in a popularity pol I. Max Planck did not attract huge numbers of students but his students became superb scientists. You know my view that most of us do not publ ish lest we perish, that we publish or in other ways do creative work because we have something to contribute. Also, in fields which are being transformed, research is essential if the faculty member is to be at the frontier of his field and thus able to teach well. Nevertheless, there is an unfortunate tendency in American education to stress quantity rather than qual ity in publication. The teacher who rewrites a mediocre contribution in a dozen different articles is sometimes favored over the person who writes once but makes an important contribution. In some fields we seem to have an amnesia about past literature. It is a functional amnesia for how else could we continue to publish more and more papers which go over the same ground as earl i er ones? More important than the evaluation of teaching is the encouragement of the teaching of undergraduates. We shall receive helpful proposals from the Special Senate Committee on Recognition of Distinction In Teaching. Our ratio of students to teachers probably ollght to be Im'lered, but even with our present ratio, by rearranging courses and sets of course offerings, we could provide every undergraduate student opportunities to work closely with professors in small classes. These opportunities already exist for some students. How do we extend the opportunities to others? How do we persuade distinguished scholars that they have a responsibility to teach beginning students and that it can be tremendously stimulating to do so? Though I favor seminar type classes, I also recognize they can sometimes be 3 euphemism for skimpy preparation by students or teachers and that some teachers are at thei r best in small groups and others need the stimulus of the lecture .udience. think there is I ittle excuse for giving the same lecture year after - 8 - year. If it is worthwhile of that much repetition, it should be written and published. Lectures should largely be restricted to new formulations and tentative materials. They should not be what many students seem to want -- an organized spooning of material the student should dig out for himself. We must realize that the faculty has become more important for the student than before. A generation ago undergraduates wanted thei r first degree and a job. Today, a large proportion of them either expect to do graduate work and teach themselves or expect to do advanced professional work in the field of thei r teachers. Students have become as a result more competitive with thei r professors. While I have found I ittle support for the notion that educational policy should be made jointly by faculty and students, I have found great support for the notion that student views and suggestions should get the greatest ai ring and that faculty-student opportunities for discussion of education must be extended widely. There are a number of problems in this evolving relation of students to faculty: the faculty and the administration must beware having -- and the students must avoid being -- ""courtll students who just give back what they think we want. Learning, which is one of the greatest pleasures of life -- partly because it does not come easi ly must be shared by the teacher and the taught. I have asked the Senate several questions. How can we provide a general education commensurate with the excitement and fluidity of modern knowledge? How shal I we in this large, diversified seat of learning provide communities or centers for intellectual identification? Can we not reassess the way we evaluate the progress of learners, whether they be faculty or students? What are the best ways in which we as a community of scholars may rededicate ourselves as a self-conscious community of teachers, both at the undergraduate level of instruction and the graduate? I doubt that there is any single committee of the Senate or of the administration which has for its competence so broad a range of questions which we now face. - 9 - Perhaps we need a kind of commission on the state of education at Berkeley. This commission, bringing together and clarifying the many ideas being suggested on the campus could then develop for our consideration specific proposals for the revitalization of our educational aims and practice. The responsibility for the educational offerings of the university rests with the faculty. Yet only through a clear understanding of the students' needs and interests can a vital program be developed. I should expect that a commission, if establ ished, would determine the best ways to elicit students' assistance. In suggesting such a commission, I am aware that many departments, schools, and councils are embarked on educational reforms. A commission would not replace but could help coordinate these efforts. For example, the College of Letters and Science is about to undertake a reevaluation of its entire program (the program was revised seven years ago). With your consent I shall ask the Emergency Executive Committee to discuss with members of the Senate and other committees of the Senate the best ways to . organize to deal with the intellectual ferment about education on our campus. expect that on the basis of these discussions the Executive Committee will make definite and practical proposals for action at our next meeting. It is the province of all of us to develop a strategy for educationul advancement. My comments have focussed on a few of the educational issues which face us and which are the proper concern of the Senate. I shall close not with a flourish but with several administrative questions which the Chancel lor's office faces and for which we would be pleased to have suggestions and advice from individual colleagues. I have agreed to make suggestions to President Kerr on the best division of administrative labor between University Hall and the campus administration and on possible ways of further decentral izing and making more effective the administration of the campu~. - 10 - I am concerned with simplification of all kinds of routine activities, including paperwork, from registration to graduation. Policies and rules on the time, place and manner for students to use campus facilities must conform with Regents' policies. I expect to meet this weekend with a Regents' committee. Following that, I expect to ci rculate a draft of proposals. On all of these matters, I respectfully seek your written comments. In closing, I want to tell you how grateful I am to you, my colleagues, for your help during these past weeks, your forbearance, and most of all, for your encouragement.

We shall receive helpful proposals from the Special Senate Committee on Recognition of Distinction In Teaching. Our ratio of students to teachers probably ollght to be Im'lered, but even with our present ratio, by rearranging courses and sets of course offerings, we could provide every undergraduate student opportunities to work closely with professors in small classes. These opportunities already exist for some students. How do we extend the opportunities to others? How do we persuade distinguished scholars that they have a responsibility to teach beginning students and that it can be tremendously stimulating to do so? Though I favor seminar type classes, I also recognize they can sometimes be 3 euphemism for skimpy preparation by students or teachers and that some teachers are at thei r best in small groups and others need the stimulus of the lecture .udience. think there is I ittle excuse for giving the same lecture year after - 8 - year. If it is worthwhile of that much repetition, it should be written and published. Lectures should largely be restricted to new formulations and tentative materials. They should not be what many students seem to want -- an organized spooning of material the student should dig out for himself. We must realize that the faculty has become more important for the student than before. A generation ago undergraduates wanted thei r first degree and a job. Today, a large proportion of them either expect to do graduate work and teach themselves or expect to do advanced professional work in the field of thei r teachers. Students have become as a result more competitive with thei r professors. While I have found I ittle support for the notion that educational policy should be made jointly by faculty and students, I have found great support for the notion that student views and suggestions should get the greatest ai ring and that faculty-student opportunities for discussion of education must be extended widely. There are a number of problems in this evolving relation of students to faculty: the faculty and the administration must beware having -- and the students must avoid being -- ""courtll students who just give back what they think we want. Learning, which is one of the greatest pleasures of life -- partly because it does not come easi ly must be shared by the teacher and the taught. I have asked the Senate several questions. How can we provide a general education commensurate with the excitement and fluidity of modern knowledge? How shal I we in this large, diversified seat of learning provide communities or centers for intellectual identification? Can we not reassess the way we evaluate the progress of learners, whether they be faculty or students? What are the best ways in which we as a community of scholars may rededicate ourselves as a self-conscious community of teachers, both at the undergraduate level of instruction and the graduate? I doubt that there is any single committee of the Senate or of the administration which has for its competence so broad a range of questions which we now face. - 9 - Perhaps we need a kind of commission on the state of education at Berkeley. This commission, bringing together and clarifying the many ideas being suggested on the campus could then develop for our consideration specific proposals for the revitalization of our educational aims and practice. The responsibility for the educational offerings of the university rests with the faculty. Yet only through a clear understanding of the students' needs and interests can a vital program be developed. I should expect that a commission, if establ ished, would determine the best ways to elicit students' assistance. In suggesting such a commission, I am aware that many departments, schools, and councils are embarked on educational reforms. A commission would not replace but could help coordinate these efforts. For example, the College of Letters and Science is about to undertake a reevaluation of its entire program (the program was revised seven years ago). With your consent I shall ask the Emergency Executive Committee to discuss with members of the Senate and other committees of the Senate the best ways to . organize to deal with the intellectual ferment about education on our campus. expect that on the basis of these discussions the Executive Committee will make definite and practical proposals for action at our next meeting. It is the province of all of us to develop a strategy for educationul advancement. My comments have focussed on a few of the educational issues which face us and which are the proper concern of the Senate. I shall close not with a flourish but with several administrative questions which the Chancel lor's office faces and for which we would be pleased to have suggestions and advice from individual colleagues. I have agreed to make suggestions to President Kerr on the best division of administrative labor between University Hall and the campus administration and on possible ways of further decentral izing and making more effective the administration of the campu~. - 10 - I am concerned with simplification of all kinds of routine activities, including paperwork, from registration to graduation. Policies and rules on the time, place and manner for students to use campus facilities must conform with Regents' policies. I expect to meet this weekend with a Regents' committee. Following that, I expect to ci rculate a draft of proposals. On all of these matters, I respectfully seek your written comments. In closing, I want to tell you how grateful I am to you, my colleagues, for your help during these past weeks, your forbearance, and most of all, for your encouragement.

25,cor1,11/1/81,Cornell University,Four Years Later,Press,Campus CT,"I am glad you put it as you did because in a place as big as Cornell what happens is only partly under the president's control. Good things have happened, and I have been involved, but they also involve the trustees, executive staff, deans, faculty, and not least the alumni. These people deserve most of the credit. I do not rank them in any order. In each case we inherited a strong foundation and built on it. • The first major group of changes were fiscal. In the ten years up to 1977, Cornell had had a very strong run on its endowment funds. We spent $55 million in capital, mostly on the Ithaca campus but including about $13 million at the Medical College. I am not criticizing the fact it was spent, but we could not continue this practice and still have any endowment income to live on. Very early I set four financial objectives for the campus and wrote a piece for the faculty and staff that came out in the spring of my first year. We have been wholly successful in meeting two of those objectives but only partly successful in the other two. The first was to build a balanced budget. Balanced meaning not to invade capital? Yes. We have had a balanced operating budget for the last three years which required real cooperation from the deans, faculty, and staff, and that has been a major achievement. I am convinced we could not have succeeded in the Cornell Campaign had we not had a balanced budget. The first thing that foundations and corporations, in particular, want to know is, ""Have you got a balanced budget and what does it look like?"" The second fiscal objective was to stop draining away annual undesignated bequests to the university. We had developed a pattern of expending those as operating income. For three years now we have put undesignated bequests in the endowment, adding perhaps threequarters of a million dollars a year. The third fiscal goal was to improve the salaries of faculty and staff. We have been less successful in achieving this goal. Nationwide, faculty salaries have not kept pace with inflation. In addition, we have slipped a point or two in relation to our peers. Our faculty and staff are not as well off as they were ten years ago. We have gained a little back recently, but not enough, and there is much to be done in this area during the next couple of years. The fourth fiscal goal was to begin putting annual operating funds aside for major maintenance of buildings and equipment. I am pleased with what we have started. You have only to look at Goldwin Smith and Rockefeller to see the effects of that kind of change. Our problem is that we have a whole campus needing renovation and we have a long way to go to build our annual maintenance and equipment fund to the level where it should be. In general, universities do not build capital depreciation into their budgets. Our greatest achievement on the financial front was the Cornell Campaign —an extraordinary contribution from Cornellians all over the world, and especially trustees. The role they played is just a remarkable one. I was especially proud that almost 4,000 individual Cornellians were involved in soliciting support. Contributions came from over 50,000 individual donors. They came from very small gifts as well as from very major ones such as the anonymous bequest for the geological sciences, and the splendid gifts from ""Roby"" [Ellis Robison Ί8], Bob Purcell '32, and Harold Uris '25. We have also done reasonably well at the Medical College. The $50 million we raised in the same period is easy to overlook when thinking of the Ithaca total. But it has been very important to the present and the future of that college. • The second fairly striking change in four years is in our administrative team. Twelve out of thirteen deans are new, as well as the director of biological sciences; seven senior members of the executive staff, and some very key people in addition to that—the directors of admissions and financial aid, of personnel, and so on, are also newly appointed. We are very fortunate in having such a high level of professionalism and commitment in the people at the top of the colleges and in the central administration team. In many ways I think the most important thing you must do as a chief executive officer in any organization is to pick the right people to work with you. We have some outstanding people, including, I should add, those who continued in office from Dale Corson. • No. 3 is facilities. Very early, as I visited the colleges and other units, it became clear to me that the campus was without doubt the most beautiful site on the continent—perhaps the University of British Columbia-Vancouver is close. But it is also clear that we had major problems with many of the buildings, either because they were obsolete for what we wanted to do or because they needed renovation so badly that although they functioned adequately they did not provide a reasonable working environment. We have worked hard. The renovation that has been done is a fine example Trustee chairman Robert Purcell '32 hands Rhodes the university mace, symbol of authority, during Inauguration at Barton Hall in 1977. of what can be done to preserve the fabric of an older building and yet completely revolutionize the interior space. The Binenkorb Center that we dedicated [at Reunion] is a beautiful example, as is the renovation of what was Goldwin Smith A, now the Hollis C. Cornell Auditorium. Rockefeller is the same: We kept the old beams and the seats in the auditorium, but the new offices and smaller rooms are beautiful. I have also pushed very hard for renovation of some of the dorm space. By the end of [this past] summer you will begin to see some of the results. I have been particularly depressed for quite a while at the state of the lounges in University Halls, for example. We have begun to renovate every lounge in that western campus complex, a total of something like thirty-eight individual lounges in all. We have also built some additional space that I think has important longterm implications for the university: One is the Gannett Clinic addition. With the old Sage Infirmary we had a building that was not really fit for people who were healthy; much less for people who were ill. In order to improve the University Health Service for students and to expand coverage to the staff (and faculty!) it was very important to close that building down and provide the more limited but superb facilities we now have in Gannett. Another is the result of a very generous gift from Harold Uris—the addition at the west of Uris Library. One of the very early things emphasized to me by Prof. Joel Silbey, who at that time was chairman of the library committee, was the desperate need we had for undergraduate study space. The addition will provide well over 200 additional study seats and what is also probably the best view on campus. We have almost finished two new buildings. One is the submicron facility, at Phillips Hall. As soon as this national facility is completed I expect to see a rapid expansion of its use by academic and industrial research teams from across the country. The other is biological sciences, a $16 million building all paid for by private funds from people who are new and old friends of Cornell. It will bring in from Langmuir Lab [north of campus] two of the most distinguished groups of biologists we have, and it should do a great deal to improve both teaching and research. Two other buildings on the drawing board are the performing arts center and a home for the geological sciences. The performing arts center represents the heart of our plan for the redevelopment of Collegetown. I consider this a high priority in our fundraising efforts. It is our front door, in many respects, and we need to brighten it up. The other big construction we are undertaking is major renovation of three older buildings—Sage Infirmary, Sheldon Court, and Cascadilla—to add student beds. Together the three will add about 550 beds when they are completed by the summer of next year. They are going to lead to a major improvement in the quality of undergraduate life • Area No. 4 is a problem that all universities have been facing: student recruitment. We have reorganized the admissions office. There is now a much closer pattern of cooperation with the colleges and we have greatly expanded our regional recruitment efforts. In spite of all the fears that many people had about loss of diversity and even loss of numbers of potential students the number of applicants to Cornell continues to increase. One in five of our entering freshmen this fall with be a minority student. The number of women continues to increase. The overall yield rate continues to go up—by almost 6 per cent on student acceptances from outside the Northeast. That growth is a very important foundation for our future. • Faculty recruitment continues to be good. I do not claim any credit for that. The institution and its general tone determines the people you can recruit, and in the last three years we recruited some outstanding men and women. You can see that in the number of prizes and fellowships they have been awarded. What is disappointing is that we see virtually no increase in the number of minority faculty. There is a critically short supply of minority faculty members, both men and women. We have seen a significant increase in the number of women. Of the faculty appointed in 1979-80, which was the last figure I had, over a quarter were women. One indication of the continuing high quality of the faculty is that we have now moved up to No. 7 in the nation in the total of research and development funding, and many of those schools ahead of us are universities that are twice or three times as big as we are. That's a remarkable achievement. • We have seen the beginning of some new academic programs. In general a president can't do much more than encourage new programs. We have seen programs like Cornell-in-Washington take off, and a great expansion of the student intern programs in Albany and in New York City. We have the Chinese exchange program coming along like an express train at the moment, and the new Institute for Economic and Social Research is going to be very important to us in the next few years. These are not major gains but they are significant additions, I think. Yes, and yes. They have been added on, but this year we will be taking $1.3 million out of the budget, so in a sense it is a substitution, though not in the sense of cutting a particular program. • Academic program support is very important. We have taken two major steps in the last two years, both difficult decisions and one controversial. One is that we joined the Research Libraries Group because no single library can purchase everything any more. We joined what has now grown to about twenty-two other major research universities—almost every one but Harvard— not only sharing information on accessions and cataloguing but actually sharing volumes. And we have begun a major upgrading of our computer facilities in an attempt to give undergraduate programs the kind of computer access they clearly need. We think the computer is as important to a great university in the long term as the library. I think in retrospect that will be seen as a timely, in fact an overdue, move. • No. 8, I have spent a lot of time on relationships with different groups. I see part of the job of the president as being deeply concerned with relationships. I formed the impression, right or wrong, early in the game, that the alumni and people on campus simply were not as proud of the university as they should be. It was not that they weren't committed, but I felt they lacked the pride that Cornell justifies. So I have taken seriously the responsibility of telling people accurately and honestly how good I think Cornell is. I'm very proud of what it is. I am very proud that it isn't Harvard, that it has a college of agriculture and life sciences, that it has a veterinary school. That is where resolutions to many of the problems of the next century will be sought. Far from being apologetic, we should capitalize on these strengths of ours. I spend a lot of time with alumni groups. The number of cities visited in considerable. I have spent a lot of time with donors and alumni leaders, a lot of NOVEMBER 1981 23 time bringing alumni groups to campus —entertaining them for dinner at my home and then spending a day with them visiting programs on campus. I spent a lot of time with faculty and students, literally trying to get everywhere on campus. It is important not so much to go around talking to people as listening and gaining an understanding of their aspirations and concerns. You can sit behind the president's desk and have no idea what is going on on campus. I continue to get out to faculty lunches, to have faculty in to my office, to go to departments, to go as faithfully as I can to University Faculty and Faculty Council of Representatives meetings. The same thing is true with students—holding regular student breakfasts, visiting student houses, and having student groups around to my house. Rosa and I have tried very deliberately to put ourselves at the disposal of the Cornell community. I think we gain a very important understanding from that. I like to think the community gains something too. And Rosa has been a superb partner in this. The debt I owe to her is enormous. I have also tried to spend time getting to know trustees. The role they play is absolutely crucial, and we depend so much on their judgment and leadership. They are an outstanding group of men and women. I have tried to do the same thing with parents. I started a parents' newsletter a few years ago with the object of keeping them in touch with events on campus. The response to that has been absolutely marvelous. Many have written to me of their concerns as well as their enthusiasm for the education Cornell provides. • The next point is the Medical College; we have a whole range of problems there that I won't talk about except to say that I really devote a great deal of time to it. I think with a new dean, Tom Meikle, we are seeing some very exciting progress. For the first time in four years we can see some major moves forward. • State and federal relations—I've spent a fair amount of time on these, also. They are an integral part of the job. Some gains, some losses! I really do not have any and that doesn't mean I have achieved all that I want to achieve. Some things I would have organized differently if I could, but no major disappointments. Rhodes and Provost Keith Kennedy, PhD '47 talk with agricultural leaders and faculty at the Experiment Station in Geneva in 77. What are the most important tasks that lie ahead? • Task No. 1 for all universities, including Cornell, is going to be financial constraint. We are in a strong position, much stronger than most, but we have a very tight state economy that is not helping us. We have pruning to do on the campus. The way to get a plant to grow vigorously and beautifully is through pruning. If we are to improve our salary levels, we simply must cut back on some services. • A second major problem, this next year in particular, is student aid. We are being hit very hard by what looks to be the final outcome of the federal budget cuts. I do not think federal funding will come back in its present form. We have to find alternative solutions; we cannot automatically provide funding to replace government funding. That remains a major question. • Third, I am involved in a series of three or four different groups now focussing on the whole question of a new partnership between universities and industry. These pop up in different ways and cross over between one another, but I have decided to spend a major slice of my time next year working on that particular problem. • I want also to concentrate on the funding for two facilities: the performing arts center and geology. We have to give Engineering [which houses geology] some relief in space and if we can move geology into a new building it will allow computer science and other growing departments there—Industrial and Operations Research, for example—to expand. We hope CESR II [the proposed giant new particle accelerator] is going to be approved. • The whole area of affirmative action is one that is going to continue to be important to us in the coming years. One of the things I also want to do is see what we can do as one of a group of universities to try and improve the supply of minority students at the graduate level. They are coming through as well qualified undergraduates but the job opportunities at the end of their undergraduate study are so attractive that there is little incentive to go into graduate work. We need good minority people in every kind of teaching area; the need is desperate. The numbers of minority people receiving a PhD are just pitifully small. Last year I believe 1,100 black PhDs were awarded across the nation, 550 of which were in education, and we don't need that many in that particular field, but we do need them in every other area. • Another area that I think someone like myself can only become involved in after he has been here some time is undergraduate education. At Cornell we have resources and commitment from the faculty that we have yet to tap. One very obvious question grows from our having eight major undergraduate colleges. Ought we to have something approaching a core curriculum there? Is it unreasonable to ask whether farmers and physicists need some kind of educational experience in common? • The Medical College remains a problem. Next year I've got three very specific objectives there. One is fundraising for the basic sciences. We are going to mount a major campaign to raise $25 million for the basic sciences. Second is a long-term planning and operating relationship with the New York Hospital. And the third is to try to develop a far more extensive working partnership with Rockefeller University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Everybody has talked about this for fifty years but has not yet done anything about it. I believe as a matter of principle and not just of convenience that universities should support medical schools, because I believe both the medical students and faculty need the influence that comes from the university, and correspondingly the university faculty needs to think about health and disease and what that means. There is a less easy case to make when you are 250 miles apart [as at Cornell] and that is part of our problem. We have double everything: two physiology departments, two biochemistry, two pathology, and so on. That is obviously a great inconvenience, but I do not believe we should give up. We should be in the business and we should be near the top in terms of quality. I believe therefore that what we should not do is have just another medical school for the sake of putting it on our letterhead. What we ought to be able to do is identify a distinctive role for Cornell. And the role I see and the one Dean Meikle is very enthusiastic about is that we continue to train a small number of people who will be medical scientists and not just practitioners. Whether they practice as clinicians or work in a research laboratory, they would be working as medical scientists. Yes, in very broad terms; at least, the research world. The great need is not just to design better care for the elderly in geriatric facilities, it is to understand the biology of disease and health in the next twenty years. Yes, but it is difficult, given the distances. I have been at a number of universities with medical schools and even if the medical campus is 300 yards away from the main campus, interaction is difficult. The only major change I see in our future relationships at the Medical Center is much closer ties with Rockefeller and Memorial Sloan-Kettering. We simply haven't tapped the potential and it is so consistent with our proposed medicalscientist emphasis. Those institutions want to work more closely with us. We have had a very positive attitude from their leaders Just marvelous. They are one of a kind. I do not believe any other university has alumni that even come close to ours. I am enough of a member of the Cornell family to be very touched by the extraordinary enthusiasm and loyalty of our alumni—both young and old. Why do you think student activists a I do not know why they acted as they did. I may be the wrong person to make that guess. Of course Cornell does differ from most other universities in the way it conducts its affairs. Most universities NOVEMBER 1981 will announce tuition increases after the meeting of their board of trustees that makes the decision. Presidents of other universities in the Ivy League and elsewhere who talk to me about the unrest we had are surprised that we would consult the student body in the way we do. I think that is the right way, but I do not pretend you can make eveybody happy. It is the job of the administration to listen to everyone, to weigh the viewpoints of everyone, and in the end make a recommendation to the trustees Yes, I am very optimistic about that. I know the skepticism [on campus] and I read the Sun and see it. I think it will be healthy for students to have their own assembly No, I do not think I throw lightning bolts. I do not think that is very effective. In this job there is something to be said for being predictable. I do not mean you should be so predictable that you never do anything new, but people should know where they stand with you and not be constantly caught off guard. I am particularly interested in seeking ways, on a continuing basis, to improve the quality of undergraduate education at Cornell. My paper on undergraduate education from 1979 [which follows this interview in the current News] reflects my beginning thoughts on this—Γd been thinking about it for a long time. I had a series of faculty lunches and talked through the topics one by onethere were probably a dozen different headings—each with a different faculty group, pulled in from all over campu No, if you take the topic of undergraduate education there is no single group that deals exactly with undergraduate education. This past year Provost Keith Kennedy and I have attended a dozen departmental lunches, which are fairly structured. But there is a more informal mixture of 7 would not serve longer than was good for Cornell; I still have many things to do' listening and suggesting at the faculty lunches we have held. Then the draft of the paper that I prepared on undergraduate education was shared with thirty or forty people before I released it. They included deans and senior faculty I talked to. The paper went through a lot of revisions. I hope that out of the twelve goals listed in the paper some will be tackled. We have made good progress on some already; others we have barely begun. One that I am very enthusiastic about where we have very limited success is the faculty-in-residence program. This past year we had only one faculty member living in the dorms. I understand that [this] year two faculty may be in residence and that an additional two faculty members will act as associate faculty-inresidence—meaning that they will not actually live in the dorms but will actively participate in the life of a specific dorm. I think the pattern of listening and suggesting and draft and feedback is one that makes some sense. I do and I don't. Only in general terms. At the beginning of every academic year, or during the summer before, I write down what my priorities are. I have actually given you the ones for [this] next year today. I talk about them with the people I work most closely with—Keith Kennedy, Bill Herbster [senior vice president], Dick Ramin [vice president for public affairs], and others. Then they suggest amendments and I put percentages against the parts. For example, I had lunch with Dick Ramin today, and we talked about the chief priorities for the time that I will spend next year on Public Affairs— whether it is alumni activities, major donors, bringing groups to campus, or public writing. I spent a fair amount of time writing this year, getting articles into the Washington Star and the Balti more Sun, on issues that I felt were urgent. They happened to be related to student financial aid. On the basis of my list we try to put a calendar together. At the end of the year there is by no means a perfect fit with that list. Something will come up that you just have to spend time on. This past year, in the spring it was the campus unrest and the time that I spent in Washington on student aid. The time mounted up appreciably. I suppose I spend six or seven days a month away from campus. I visited about forty cities to meet with alumni in the last three or four years. When I go for a major alumni visit I talk to individual leaders and donors, and I usually attend a lunch for corporate leaders, and talk about Cornell and independent universities. A lot of time is spent visiting foundations and corporations, seeking financial help, and visiting legislators in Washington and Albany for the same purpose. A fair amount of time is spent with associations: I am involved with a number of groups, something called the Governmental Relations Commission of ACE [the American Council on Education], with AAU [the American Association of Universities] on the whole question of industrial-university relations. I have just been elected to the board of COFHE, the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, to work with other similar institutions during the next two years in particular on the question of student aid. I am on the Carnegie Foundation board, and was involved in the study that came out a couple of months ago on the Quest for Common Learning. On a typical campus day I come in at 8 in the morning and I rarely leave before 6. The day will be a mixture—meeting with people on this [third] floor of Day Hall and a fair amount of time meeting with committees and groups. Yesterday afternoon we spent three and a half hours looking at the university's building and renovation program for next year, just raising questions: ""What are our priorities for next year?"" We took in everything from the Collegetown scheme to life safety in the U-Halls, to some rooms in Martha Van. It is an astonishing variety That is right. That is a change I made this year.

Good things have happened, and I have been involved, but they also involve the trustees, executive staff, deans, faculty, and not least the alumni. These people deserve most of the credit. I do not rank them in any order. In each case we inherited a strong foundation and built on it. • The first major group of changes were fiscal. In the ten years up to 1977, Cornell had had a very strong run on its endowment funds. We spent $55 million in capital, mostly on the Ithaca campus but including about $13 million at the Medical College. I am not criticizing the fact it was spent, but we could not continue this practice and still have any endowment income to live on. Very early I set four financial objectives for the campus and wrote a piece for the faculty and staff that came out in the spring of my first year. We have been wholly successful in meeting two of those objectives but only partly successful in the other two. The first was to build a balanced budget. Balanced meaning not to invade capital? Yes. We have had a balanced operating budget for the last three years which required real cooperation from the deans, faculty, and staff, and that has been a major achievement. I am convinced we could not have succeeded in the Cornell Campaign had we not had a balanced budget. The first thing that foundations and corporations, in particular, want to know is, ""Have you got a balanced budget and what does it look like?"" The second fiscal objective was to stop draining away annual undesignated bequests to the university. We had developed a pattern of expending those as operating income. For three years now we have put undesignated bequests in the endowment, adding perhaps threequarters of a million dollars a year. The third fiscal goal was to improve the salaries of faculty and staff. We have been less successful in achieving this goal. Nationwide, faculty salaries have not kept pace with inflation. In addition, we have slipped a point or two in relation to our peers. Our faculty and staff are not as well off as they were ten years ago. We have gained a little back recently, but not enough, and there is much to be done in this area during the next couple of years. The fourth fiscal goal was to begin putting annual operating funds aside for major maintenance of buildings and equipment. I am pleased with what we have started. You have only to look at Goldwin Smith and Rockefeller to see the effects of that kind of change. Our problem is that we have a whole campus needing renovation and we have a long way to go to build our annual maintenance and equipment fund to the level where it should be. In general, universities do not build capital depreciation into their budgets. Our greatest achievement on the financial front was the Cornell Campaign —an extraordinary contribution from Cornellians all over the world, and especially trustees. The role they played is just a remarkable one. I was especially proud that almost 4,000 individual Cornellians were involved in soliciting support. Contributions came from over 50,000 individual donors. They came from very small gifts as well as from very major ones such as the anonymous bequest for the geological sciences, and the splendid gifts from ""Roby"" [Ellis Robison Ί8], Bob Purcell '32, and Harold Uris '25. We have also done reasonably well at the Medical College. The $50 million we raised in the same period is easy to overlook when thinking of the Ithaca total. But it has been very important to the present and the future of that college. • The second fairly striking change in four years is in our administrative team. Twelve out of thirteen deans are new, as well as the director of biological sciences; seven senior members of the executive staff, and some very key people in addition to that—the directors of admissions and financial aid, of personnel, and so on, are also newly appointed. We are very fortunate in having such a high level of professionalism and commitment in the people at the top of the colleges and in the central administration team. In many ways I think the most important thing you must do as a chief executive officer in any organization is to pick the right people to work with you. We have some outstanding people, including, I should add, those who continued in office from Dale Corson. • No. 3 is facilities. Very early, as I visited the colleges and other units, it became clear to me that the campus was without doubt the most beautiful site on the continent—perhaps the University of British Columbia-Vancouver is close. But it is also clear that we had major problems with many of the buildings, either because they were obsolete for what we wanted to do or because they needed renovation so badly that although they functioned adequately they did not provide a reasonable working environment. We have worked hard. The renovation that has been done is a fine example Trustee chairman Robert Purcell '32 hands Rhodes the university mace, symbol of authority, during Inauguration at Barton Hall in 1977. of what can be done to preserve the fabric of an older building and yet completely revolutionize the interior space. The Binenkorb Center that we dedicated [at Reunion] is a beautiful example, as is the renovation of what was Goldwin Smith A, now the Hollis C. Cornell Auditorium. Rockefeller is the same: We kept the old beams and the seats in the auditorium, but the new offices and smaller rooms are beautiful. I have also pushed very hard for renovation of some of the dorm space. By the end of [this past] summer you will begin to see some of the results. I have been particularly depressed for quite a while at the state of the lounges in University Halls, for example. We have begun to renovate every lounge in that western campus complex, a total of something like thirty-eight individual lounges in all. We have also built some additional space that I think has important longterm implications for the university: One is the Gannett Clinic addition. With the old Sage Infirmary we had a building that was not really fit for people who were healthy; much less for people who were ill. In order to improve the University Health Service for students and to expand coverage to the staff (and faculty!) it was very important to close that building down and provide the more limited but superb facilities we now have in Gannett. Another is the result of a very generous gift from Harold Uris—the addition at the west of Uris Library. One of the very early things emphasized to me by Prof. Joel Silbey, who at that time was chairman of the library committee, was the desperate need we had for undergraduate study space. The addition will provide well over 200 additional study seats and what is also probably the best view on campus. We have almost finished two new buildings. One is the submicron facility, at Phillips Hall. As soon as this national facility is completed I expect to see a rapid expansion of its use by academic and industrial research teams from across the country. The other is biological sciences, a $16 million building all paid for by private funds from people who are new and old friends of Cornell. It will bring in from Langmuir Lab [north of campus] two of the most distinguished groups of biologists we have, and it should do a great deal to improve both teaching and research. Two other buildings on the drawing board are the performing arts center and a home for the geological sciences. The performing arts center represents the heart of our plan for the redevelopment of Collegetown. I consider this a high priority in our fundraising efforts. It is our front door, in many respects, and we need to brighten it up. The other big construction we are undertaking is major renovation of three older buildings—Sage Infirmary, Sheldon Court, and Cascadilla—to add student beds. Together the three will add about 550 beds when they are completed by the summer of next year. They are going to lead to a major improvement in the quality of undergraduate life • Area No. 4 is a problem that all universities have been facing: student recruitment. We have reorganized the admissions office. There is now a much closer pattern of cooperation with the colleges and we have greatly expanded our regional recruitment efforts. In spite of all the fears that many people had about loss of diversity and even loss of numbers of potential students the number of applicants to Cornell continues to increase. One in five of our entering freshmen this fall with be a minority student. The number of women continues to increase. The overall yield rate continues to go up—by almost 6 per cent on student acceptances from outside the Northeast. That growth is a very important foundation for our future. • Faculty recruitment continues to be good. I do not claim any credit for that. The institution and its general tone determines the people you can recruit, and in the last three years we recruited some outstanding men and women. You can see that in the number of prizes and fellowships they have been awarded. What is disappointing is that we see virtually no increase in the number of minority faculty. There is a critically short supply of minority faculty members, both men and women. We have seen a significant increase in the number of women. Of the faculty appointed in 1979-80, which was the last figure I had, over a quarter were women. One indication of the continuing high quality of the faculty is that we have now moved up to No. 7 in the nation in the total of research and development funding, and many of those schools ahead of us are universities that are twice or three times as big as we are. That's a remarkable achievement. • We have seen the beginning of some new academic programs. In general a president can't do much more than encourage new programs. We have seen programs like Cornell-in-Washington take off, and a great expansion of the student intern programs in Albany and in New York City. We have the Chinese exchange program coming along like an express train at the moment, and the new Institute for Economic and Social Research is going to be very important to us in the next few years. These are not major gains but they are significant additions, I think. Yes, and yes. They have been added on, but this year we will be taking $1.3 million out of the budget, so in a sense it is a substitution, though not in the sense of cutting a particular program. • Academic program support is very important. We have taken two major steps in the last two years, both difficult decisions and one controversial. One is that we joined the Research Libraries Group because no single library can purchase everything any more. We joined what has now grown to about twenty-two other major research universities—almost every one but Harvard— not only sharing information on accessions and cataloguing but actually sharing volumes. And we have begun a major upgrading of our computer facilities in an attempt to give undergraduate programs the kind of computer access they clearly need. We think the computer is as important to a great university in the long term as the library. I think in retrospect that will be seen as a timely, in fact an overdue, move. • No. 8, I have spent a lot of time on relationships with different groups. I see part of the job of the president as being deeply concerned with relationships. I formed the impression, right or wrong, early in the game, that the alumni and people on campus simply were not as proud of the university as they should be. It was not that they weren't committed, but I felt they lacked the pride that Cornell justifies. So I have taken seriously the responsibility of telling people accurately and honestly how good I think Cornell is. I'm very proud of what it is. I am very proud that it isn't Harvard, that it has a college of agriculture and life sciences, that it has a veterinary school. That is where resolutions to many of the problems of the next century will be sought. Far from being apologetic, we should capitalize on these strengths of ours. I spend a lot of time with alumni groups. The number of cities visited in considerable. I have spent a lot of time with donors and alumni leaders, a lot of NOVEMBER 1981 23 time bringing alumni groups to campus —entertaining them for dinner at my home and then spending a day with them visiting programs on campus. I spent a lot of time with faculty and students, literally trying to get everywhere on campus. It is important not so much to go around talking to people as listening and gaining an understanding of their aspirations and concerns. You can sit behind the president's desk and have no idea what is going on on campus. I continue to get out to faculty lunches, to have faculty in to my office, to go to departments, to go as faithfully as I can to University Faculty and Faculty Council of Representatives meetings. The same thing is true with students—holding regular student breakfasts, visiting student houses, and having student groups around to my house. Rosa and I have tried very deliberately to put ourselves at the disposal of the Cornell community. I think we gain a very important understanding from that. I like to think the community gains something too. And Rosa has been a superb partner in this. The debt I owe to her is enormous. I have also tried to spend time getting to know trustees. The role they play is absolutely crucial, and we depend so much on their judgment and leadership. They are an outstanding group of men and women. I have tried to do the same thing with parents. I started a parents' newsletter a few years ago with the object of keeping them in touch with events on campus. The response to that has been absolutely marvelous. Many have written to me of their concerns as well as their enthusiasm for the education Cornell provides. • The next point is the Medical College; we have a whole range of problems there that I won't talk about except to say that I really devote a great deal of time to it. I think with a new dean, Tom Meikle, we are seeing some very exciting progress. For the first time in four years we can see some major moves forward. • State and federal relations—I've spent a fair amount of time on these, also. They are an integral part of the job. Some gains, some losses! I really do not have any and that doesn't mean I have achieved all that I want to achieve. Some things I would have organized differently if I could, but no major disappointments. Rhodes and Provost Keith Kennedy, PhD '47 talk with agricultural leaders and faculty at the Experiment Station in Geneva in 77. What are the most important tasks that lie ahead? • Task No. 1 for all universities, including Cornell, is going to be financial constraint. We are in a strong position, much stronger than most, but we have a very tight state economy that is not helping us. We have pruning to do on the campus. The way to get a plant to grow vigorously and beautifully is through pruning. If we are to improve our salary levels, we simply must cut back on some services. • A second major problem, this next year in particular, is student aid. We are being hit very hard by what looks to be the final outcome of the federal budget cuts. I do not think federal funding will come back in its present form. We have to find alternative solutions; we cannot automatically provide funding to replace government funding. That remains a major question. • Third, I am involved in a series of three or four different groups now focussing on the whole question of a new partnership between universities and industry. These pop up in different ways and cross over between one another, but I have decided to spend a major slice of my time next year working on that particular problem. • I want also to concentrate on the funding for two facilities: the performing arts center and geology. We have to give Engineering [which houses geology] some relief in space and if we can move geology into a new building it will allow computer science and other growing departments there—Industrial and Operations Research, for example—to expand. We hope CESR II [the proposed giant new particle accelerator] is going to be approved. • The whole area of affirmative action is one that is going to continue to be important to us in the coming years. One of the things I also want to do is see what we can do as one of a group of universities to try and improve the supply of minority students at the graduate level. They are coming through as well qualified undergraduates but the job opportunities at the end of their undergraduate study are so attractive that there is little incentive to go into graduate work. We need good minority people in every kind of teaching area; the need is desperate. The numbers of minority people receiving a PhD are just pitifully small. Last year I believe 1,100 black PhDs were awarded across the nation, 550 of which were in education, and we don't need that many in that particular field, but we do need them in every other area. • Another area that I think someone like myself can only become involved in after he has been here some time is undergraduate education. At Cornell we have resources and commitment from the faculty that we have yet to tap. One very obvious question grows from our having eight major undergraduate colleges. Ought we to have something approaching a core curriculum there? Is it unreasonable to ask whether farmers and physicists need some kind of educational experience in common? • The Medical College remains a problem. Next year I've got three very specific objectives there. One is fundraising for the basic sciences. We are going to mount a major campaign to raise $25 million for the basic sciences. Second is a long-term planning and operating relationship with the New York Hospital. And the third is to try to develop a far more extensive working partnership with Rockefeller University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Everybody has talked about this for fifty years but has not yet done anything about it. I believe as a matter of principle and not just of convenience that universities should support medical schools, because I believe both the medical students and faculty need the influence that comes from the university, and correspondingly the university faculty needs to think about health and disease and what that means. There is a less easy case to make when you are 250 miles apart [as at Cornell] and that is part of our problem. We have double everything: two physiology departments, two biochemistry, two pathology, and so on. That is obviously a great inconvenience, but I do not believe we should give up. We should be in the business and we should be near the top in terms of quality. I believe therefore that what we should not do is have just another medical school for the sake of putting it on our letterhead. What we ought to be able to do is identify a distinctive role for Cornell. And the role I see and the one Dean Meikle is very enthusiastic about is that we continue to train a small number of people who will be medical scientists and not just practitioners. Whether they practice as clinicians or work in a research laboratory, they would be working as medical scientists. Yes, in very broad terms; at least, the research world. The great need is not just to design better care for the elderly in geriatric facilities, it is to understand the biology of disease and health in the next twenty years. Yes, but it is difficult, given the distances. I have been at a number of universities with medical schools and even if the medical campus is 300 yards away from the main campus, interaction is difficult. The only major change I see in our future relationships at the Medical Center is much closer ties with Rockefeller and Memorial Sloan-Kettering. We simply haven't tapped the potential and it is so consistent with our proposed medicalscientist emphasis. Those institutions want to work more closely with us. We have had a very positive attitude from their leaders Just marvelous. They are one of a kind. I do not believe any other university has alumni that even come close to ours. I am enough of a member of the Cornell family to be very touched by the extraordinary enthusiasm and loyalty of our alumni—both young and old. Why do you think student activists a I do not know why they acted as they did. I may be the wrong person to make that guess.

I think that is the right way, but I do not pretend you can make eveybody happy. It is the job of the administration to listen to everyone, to weigh the viewpoints of everyone, and in the end make a recommendation to the trustees Yes, I am very optimistic about that. I know the skepticism [on campus] and I read the Sun and see it. I think it will be healthy for students to have their own assembly No, I do not think I throw lightning bolts. I do not think that is very effective. In this job there is something to be said for being predictable. I do not mean you should be so predictable that you never do anything new, but people should know where they stand with you and not be constantly caught off guard.

26,cor2,6/1/85,Cornell University,"State University, Cornell wrestle with relations to New York State",Testimony,Political CT,"In 1960, another distinguished commission headed by Henry Heald, Marion Folson, and John Gardner reported to Governor Nelson Rockefeller and the Legislature regarding the status of the then fledgling State Universtiy of New York. The commissioners set three goals for higher education in the state, two of which bear directly on the findings of the present commission: The Heald report asked the governor and the Legislature: to assure a ""wide availability and diversity of educational opportunity to students with various intellectual capabilities and of all income classes in the State'* and to assure ""the attainment of excellence in academic instruction and research ..."" A quarter of a century later, after an era of unprecedented expansion, we congratulate the State University for meeting the first of these goals. SUNY has provided a broad educational experience to hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, many of whom would not have attended a college or university, except for SUNY's dramatic growth. The findings of the present commission, however, make it clear that State University has not met the second goal. SUNY has not yet achieved a position of national leadership in research and graduate education. This failure is not merely regrettable on academic grounds, important as those considerations may be. It is also regrettable because, in the words of the SUNY Commission, the state has lacked a state university system that can serve, in full partnership with private universities, ""as a magnet for industry and a force for community and economic development."" The commission attributes this failure to over-regulation and argues that, because of over-regulation, SUNY lacks the flexibility to compete with leading universities elsewhere. The commission recommends that SUNY become a public benefit corporation which would be free of the many restrictions which govern the administrative agencies of the state government. I have no wish, at this time, to evaluate the merits of converting SUNY into a public benefit corporation, and I think it premature to comment upon the specifics of the legislative proposal which SUNY has submitted to the governor. At the very outset, however, let me emphatically state that I strongly support the general concept of more freedom for SUNY, which would permit the achievement of higher quality in graduate education and research. As the SUNY Commission notes, the statutory or contract colleges at Cornell are among the most distinguished in the nation. There is no reason why they cannot continue to prosper into the indefinite future despite the rising level of national competition for leadership in the field of graduate education, scientific research, and high technology development. That continued success, however, is dependent upon a modification of the statutory and contractual arrangements with the state which will give to Cornell the same freedom of program development as SUNY seeks for itself. That freedom, we believe, can only be achieved if Cornell has the right of direct access to the governor and the Legislature regarding our annual budget proposals. In sum, the trustees and administration of Cornell University endorse the findings of the report which recommend what might be called a deregulation of the State University. Most particularly, we support the statement of the commission that ""New York State has handicapped both itself and SUNY over the years by relying on traditional governmental mechanisms that are not suited for the management of higher education."" Freedom and responsibility are the twin organizational principles upon which every great university in the nation, private or public, must rest. Freedom, in the academic context, means that a university administration and board of trustees must have clearly articulated goals. They must have the administrative ability to marshal financial and human resources which are needed to achieve those goals. Most importantly, they must have the freedom, courage, and determination to make hard choices in support of excellence. Responsibility, in the case of a state institution, means that the governor and Legislature must be given sufficient information to understand the goals recommended by the trustees and to accept or modify them in the public interest. The expenditure of public funds, of course, must be subject to careful postaudit. I am gratified to learn that the governor has endorsed the spirit of the commission report and will ask the Legislature to support further liberalization and deregulation. I hope and trust that this spirit will also extend to needed reforms in the relationship between Cornell and the State University. These reforms, we believe, would serve the very same important purposes. As you know, Cornell operates the New York State colleges of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Veterinary Medicine, Industrial and Labor Relations, and Human Ecology. At present, and for a century past, these colleges have been defined by law as ""colleges furnishing higher education operated by private institutions on behalf of the state pursuant to statute or contractual agreements."" From the establishment of the earliest statutory or contract college at Cornell in 1894, state oversight of these colleges has been exercised by a variety of state officials, notably the commissioner of education. Since 1948, these colleges continue to be operated by private institutions but under ""the general supervision"" of the State University trustees. Formerly, the commissioners of education confined state oversight to financial and fiscal matters. The fact that State University trustees, unlike former state overseers, are engaged in the actual operation of an educational enterprise has complicated the relationship. The reason is simple. Financial and fiscal issues cannot be separated from educational priorities and purposes. The present ambiguous and complicated relationship must be revised and simplified if we hope to protect and preserve the leading place in research and graduate education which the New York State contract colleges at Cornell have won. As you know, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences is probably the premier institution of its kind in the nation. The College of Veterinary Medicine, though threatened, is still among the best two or three in the country. The College of Human Ecology and the School of Industrial and Labor Relations are recognized as among the best of their kind. The colleges of Agriculture and Life Sciences and Veterinary Medicine, along with the endowed colleges, are deeply involved with the Biotechnology Institute and the new $60 million Supercomputer Center recently announced by the National Science Foundation. These colleges are magnets for industry and forces for economic growth in New York State. In short, taken together, the endowed and contract colleges of Cornell are critically important to the commerce and industry of the state as we approach the 21st century. We recognize, of course, that freedom and responsibility are inseparable. We accept the overseer role of the State of New York in relation to the statutory or contract colleges. We can continue to accept the ""general supervision'* of the State University trustees. However, in order to protect the excellence of these colleges, we believe, most fervently, that the contract should be modified by statute to recognize and confirm the right and duty of Cornell to present our academic and research priorities and our budget for these colleges to the governor and then to explain and defend that budget in the Legislature. Under the present statutory arrangement, the Cornell budget proposal for her four contract colleges is submerged in a massive SUNY fiscal program which also attempts to deal with 59 other and very dissimilar institutions, including 29 state-operated units and 30 community colleges. That arrangement is not calculated to recognize the unique role of Cornell as the land grant institution of the state. It is not designed to focus upon research and graduate programs of exceptional quality. It cannot. It is our experience that the internal constraints and pressures of the SUNY system, with the best will in the world, effectively exclude that possibility. What is the solution to the shortcomings which the commission has noted regarding research and graduate education and, consistent with that search for solutions, how do we protect the high quality of the state contract colleges at Cornell? I do not pretend to know which specific remedies should be applied to the various graduate programs of the stateoperated system. I can only reiterate that deregulation, in some form, is the vital first step. Thereafter the SUNY trustees must be free to state their priorities, to marshal human and financial resources for the entire state-operated system, and then to muster the determination to apply them in support of high-quality programs. As to the statutory or contract colleges at Cornell, we have engaged in serious and searching discussion with the SUNY Board of Trustees regarding needed reforms in the relationship. In that connection, I wish to take this public occasion to thank Chairman Donald Blinken and Chancellor Clifton Wharto'n for their interest in our views and their willingness to listen. The continuation of that spirit is vital to all our future efforts. However, we have not been able to reach agreement with them. We now believe that legislation is necessary which would guarantee to Cornell, as the land grant institution of the state, the right of direct access to the governor and the Legislature. We shall now develop a legislative proposal which extends to Cornell the necessary freedom of access to the elected representatives of the people.

27,cor3,6/3/74,Cornell University,Commencement Address,Remarks,Campus CT,"In these days of ""double digit"" inflation, one of the cheapest commodities in the marketplace is still the commencement address. While copper tubing, gasoline, bread, and mortgage costs soar, and cost of living rates of ten, eleven, twelve per cent are quoted without the blink of an eyelash, you can still get a commencement address for free -- particularly in season, during May and June. There are two reasons why inflation hasn't affected commencement. One is simple economics. There's a great supply -- every commencement must have an address -- and little demand commencement addresses only lengthen the ceremonies unnecessarily. The other reason is the law of the captive consumer. Most commencement speakers -- and this is particularly true of university presidents -- seldom get an opportunity to speak to such a large and captive audience. The principle is basically ""hold off the degrees until I share with them my wisdom."" At any rate, you are about to hear a commencement address. delete your expletives. Please We live in a sober era. More and more we hear that the year 1974 is only ten years away from George Orwell's ""1984"". And more and more, people are inclined to believe that perhaps Orwell was right and that the ugly new world which he set down in fiction might well become a reality. - 2 - E. B. White wrote in recent months of his impression of 1974. He said, ""Meantime, along comes 1974, with the country headed downhill all the way -- trains not running, tides unharnessed, mails overburdened with duplicate copies of seed catalogues, Nixon suspected of wrongdoing, and movie companies luring youngsters to dirty pictures by putting an X on them. Downhill all the way. You can get your mind off it by building a wheelbarrow, but you can't change the direction without some drastic alterations. I'm not afraid of the human race's running out of energy, but I sometimes despair of its ever doing anything in a sensible manner."" That was E. B. White, Cornell Class of 1921. This day and age cries out for sensibility and for sensitivity. As a nation and as individuals, we must bring order out of the chaos which surrounds us by maintaining our integrity, by displaying our maturity, and by persevering. The United States is approaching its two hundredth birthday. I hope it will be a happy birthday, but I'm not sure. Emeritus Professor Milton Konvitz tells us that Walt Whitman, writing in 1871, just before the nation's first centennial, surveyed the national conscience and said that ''society in these states is cankered, crude, superstitious and rotten."" We might take some consolation from the fact, as Konvitz has pointed out, that although much of what Whitman wrote for 1876 can still be read as relevant and true, certain important positive revisions need to be made. There are countervailing forces at work today which give us a basis for optimism as 1976 approaches. - 3 - John Henry Cardinal Newman tells us ""in our height of hope, ever to be sober; in our depth of desolation, never to despair."" Despair we must not and hope we must. But, we must also be realistic. We need a perception of reality which places on individuals the responsibility for social consequences. To build confidence and hope, a society needs leadership, but it seems that suddenly the world is bereft of leadership. There are few, if any, heroes. Rabbi Arnold Wolf of Yale says that young people today admire most those whom he terms ""the virtuosi of suffering"". Those who should be the leaders and the heroes, those to whom we should look for examples are not setting the example. During the October term of the United States Supreme Court in 1927, Associate Justice Louis Brandeis wrote a dissenting opinion in the case of Olmstead v. United States. In his dissent, Mr. Justice Brandeis said ""Decency, security and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled (sic) if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy."" Ironically, the Olmstead case involved, in 1927, the tapping of telephones by the Federal Government in an attempt to gain evidence in a case of alleged conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act. - 4 - Another Brandeis statement is of particular note today. He said, ""The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding."" It's the mission of universities such as Cornell to foster in the individuals whom they have educated the understanding and values necessary to the preservation of our society. University campuses have frequently provided the warning signs of impending social crisis. Events and issues have surfaced on the campuses some years ago and are only now becoming apparent in other segments of society. Since the early '60s our students have been telling us that there is a moral crisis in America. The microcosm of student live foreshadows the macrocosm of society. Just about a month ago, the Cornell Daily Sun ran an article dealing with the plague of food pilfering from University dining facilities. Apples, oranges , teabags, silverware and cups were pilfered, according to comments quoted by the Sun, ""because it's there"", or ""to get my money's worth."" Does private immorality lead to public immorality? Is Watergate an aberration or is it an appalling symptom of our modern way of life? At the meat counter, the shopper is wary of packaging devices and lights which make the meat deceptively appealing. At the television repair shop, the auto service garage, the hotel or motel, one must be wary of sloppy work, work recorded but not done, or bills which have been padded. On the Cornell campus, one must keep close check on one's wallet, pocketbook, bicycles, books, jackets and on and on - 5 - through the litany of items which appear as stolen each day on the Safety Division's morning report. Have we lowered our personal standards of morality to the point where public morality can result in national traumas such as Watergate? As Norman Cousins asked editorially when writing recently on the topic ""Watergate and Main Street"", ""How can we impeach ourselves?"" And Archibald Cox, speaking of the erosion of public confidence in government, has said that ""under governmental institutions as democratic as ours the erosion means our loss of confidence in ourselves."" The dimensions of the moral crisis are of such magnitude that we are left with little enthusiasm to tackle anything which requires national unity and determination. The luster, the national drive to achieve, has faded. Not only have we as students, parents, educators, and friends of education suffered, but higher education itself.has suffered. For example, the very commodity required to maintain this nation's self-sufficiency in the energy crisis is the development of high quality intellect at the most advanced levels of science, engineering, political science, economics and all the other scholarly disciplines. This intellectual commodity seems not to be valued in Washington. I fear paralysis as far as any kind of national action or national resolve or national ability to deal with hard problems is concerned. You may be asking yourself, ""What right do members of the academic community have to adopt such a 'holier-than-thou' attitude?"" - 6 - I agree with the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education which said that members of the academic community should keep two things in mind: one is that they are not the only people in society with a right to evaluate society; and second, that they have not necessarily been endowed either with a higher sense of morality or the quality of better generalized judgment than other persons in society. Even with these qualifications in mind, however, the Commission, in its 1973 study of the purposes and performance of American higher education, said, and I agree, that ""higher education does have as one of its purposes the defense of the right of, and provision of facilities for, evaluation of society, in its component parts and in its totality by its faculty members and its students in their individual capacities."" Therein lies the hope of the future -- in the University and in its students and in its graduates. From universities like Cornell must come the new visions, the new imagination which must uplift the American spirit. Let me speak directly now to those of you who will receive degrees today. When Willard Straight -- that's the man, not the building -- founded ""The New Republic"" Magazine in 1914, he said it was intended ""less to inform its readers than to start little insurrections in the realm of their convictions."" I hope that your years at Cornell have started little insurrections in the realm of your convictions. For from such insurrections come stronger convictions and this nation needs men and women of the strongest conviction. - 7 - You leave Cornell on this beautiful June day at a decisive time, not only for your country and the society in which you live, but also for you personally. James Russell Lowell wrote in that long poem, ""The Present Crisis"", ""Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide, in the strife of truth with falsehood for the good or evil side ... "" The hope for the salvation of our society rests with you and the others in your generation. I ask you to make a choice. Do not let that choice, to use Lowell's words, go ''by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light."" You must sustain society. Give it all the energy you have. Be understanding and respect others. Be compassionate, not arrogant. Never exploit or coerce. Be guided by both your conscience and your heart. In other words, live a moral life. I am certain you will and that we at Cornell can say of you what Charles Dickens said of Sydney Carton in ""The Tale of Two Cities"", that you are capable of ""good things, great things, even magnanimous things."" Goodbye and good luck.",https://cornell74.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1974-Commencement-Speech-Corson-1.pdf,Dale Corson,Male,9/5/69,1732,Republican,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Ithaca,NY,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",27,"In these days of ""double digit"" inflation, one of the cheapest commodities in the marketplace is still the commencement address.

In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled (sic) if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy."" Ironically, the Olmstead case involved, in 1927, the tapping of telephones by the Federal Government in an attempt to gain evidence in a case of alleged conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act. - 4 - Another Brandeis statement is of particular note today. He said, ""The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding."" It's the mission of universities such as Cornell to foster in the individuals whom they have educated the understanding and values necessary to the preservation of our society. University campuses have frequently provided the warning signs of impending social crisis. Events and issues have surfaced on the campuses some years ago and are only now becoming apparent in other segments of society. Since the early '60s our students have been telling us that there is a moral crisis in America. The microcosm of student live foreshadows the macrocosm of society. Just about a month ago, the Cornell Daily Sun ran an article dealing with the plague of food pilfering from University dining facilities. Apples, oranges , teabags, silverware and cups were pilfered, according to comments quoted by the Sun, ""because it's there"", or ""to get my money's worth."" Does private immorality lead to public immorality? Is Watergate an aberration or is it an appalling symptom of our modern way of life? At the meat counter, the shopper is wary of packaging devices and lights which make the meat deceptively appealing. At the television repair shop, the auto service garage, the hotel or motel, one must be wary of sloppy work, work recorded but not done, or bills which have been padded. On the Cornell campus, one must keep close check on one's wallet, pocketbook, bicycles, books, jackets and on and on - 5 - through the litany of items which appear as stolen each day on the Safety Division's morning report. Have we lowered our personal standards of morality to the point where public morality can result in national traumas such as Watergate? As Norman Cousins asked editorially when writing recently on the topic ""Watergate and Main Street"", ""How can we impeach ourselves?"" And Archibald Cox, speaking of the erosion of public confidence in government, has said that ""under governmental institutions as democratic as ours the erosion means our loss of confidence in ourselves."" The dimensions of the moral crisis are of such magnitude that we are left with little enthusiasm to tackle anything which requires national unity and determination. The luster, the national drive to achieve, has faded. Not only have we as students, parents, educators, and friends of education suffered, but higher education itself.has suffered. For example, the very commodity required to maintain this nation's self-sufficiency in the energy crisis is the development of high quality intellect at the most advanced levels of science, engineering, political science, economics and all the other scholarly disciplines. This intellectual commodity seems not to be valued in Washington. I fear paralysis as far as any kind of national action or national resolve or national ability to deal with hard problems is concerned. You may be asking yourself, ""What right do members of the academic community have to adopt such a 'holier-than-thou' attitude?"" - 6 - I agree with the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education which said that members of the academic community should keep two things in mind: one is that they are not the only people in society with a right to evaluate society; and second, that they have not necessarily been endowed either with a higher sense of morality or the quality of better generalized judgment than other persons in society. Even with these qualifications in mind, however, the Commission, in its 1973 study of the purposes and performance of American higher education, said, and I agree, that ""higher education does have as one of its purposes the defense of the right of, and provision of facilities for, evaluation of society, in its component parts and in its totality by its faculty members and its students in their individual capacities."" Therein lies the hope of the future -- in the University and in its students and in its graduates. From universities like Cornell must come the new visions, the new imagination which must uplift the American spirit. Let me speak directly now to those of you who will receive degrees today. When Willard Straight -- that's the man, not the building -- founded ""The New Republic"" Magazine in 1914, he said it was intended ""less to inform its readers than to start little insurrections in the realm of their convictions."" I hope that your years at Cornell have started little insurrections in the realm of your convictions. For from such insurrections come stronger convictions and this nation needs men and women of the strongest conviction. - 7 - You leave Cornell on this beautiful June day at a decisive time, not only for your country and the society in which you live, but also for you personally. James Russell Lowell wrote in that long poem, ""The Present Crisis"", ""Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide, in the strife of truth with falsehood for the good or evil side ... "" The hope for the salvation of our society rests with you and the others in your generation. I ask you to make a choice. Do not let that choice, to use Lowell's words, go ''by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light."" You must sustain society. Give it all the energy you have. Be understanding and respect others. Be compassionate, not arrogant. Never exploit or coerce. Be guided by both your conscience and your heart. In other words, live a moral life. I am certain you will and that we at Cornell can say of you what Charles Dickens said of Sydney Carton in ""The Tale of Two Cities"", that you are capable of ""good things, great things, even magnanimous things."" Goodbye and good luck.",1729,0.019256308,0.015272244,0.032536521,0.024568393,0.076361222,0.090969456,0.029880478,0.013944223,0.004648074,0.015272244,0.008632138,0.051128818,0.021912351,0.037848606,0.065737052,0.090969456,0.019256308,0.017928287,0.086985392,0.27689243,0.1812749,0.331341301,0.217795485,0.269588313,6/3/74,"Reagan

28,cor4,3/1/78,Cornell University,A Report to the Trustees of Cornell University (pp 169-),Message,Campus CT,"INTRODUCTION It is not often that a university president gets a chance to tell a board of trustees where to go or, more exactly, where they should be going and what they should look for en route. But when one becomes a university chancellor, telling the trustees where to go is written into the job description. I hope also to give you my views about some of the places we have been, where we are now, and about the road signs I think you are likely to see on the route ahead. I believe that higher education in this country is in a period of rapid and, possibly, profound change. My intent is to put this change and potential change into some degree of perspective for you. At the same time, I also have some comments particular to Cornell University, which I shall give you for whatever they are worth. They are simply the distillation of thirty-one years of Cornell watching and Cornell living. Before proceeding to the perspective and the distillation, I want to thank you for my more than thirty-one years at Cornell. It has been a privilege to be here. I thank you for your encouragement, your support, your patience, and your wisdom during my years as president, and I commend you for your devotion to the University. My years as president were turbulent ones, and they were challenging ones. There were periods of despair and periods of hope, periods of frustration and periods of accomplishment, and there was one period of pure joy. It lasted from December 31, 1969 to January 1, 1970. The year 1969 had finally come to an end. Through all my years, you were steadfast in your devotion and in your support. I am grateful. In discussing the current state of higher education, some of the things I have to say are based on solid fact: the size of the traditional college-going student pool will decrease sharply in the next decade, for example. Some of the things / have to discuss are based on likely developments: the amount of money from public sources going into private higher education seems likely to increase, for instance. Some of my comments are pure conjecture: the possible revolt by the public over the ever-widening gap between the cost of attending a public institution and that of attending a private one, for example. What I give you in this discussion is my own opinion, and I am no seer. There is no guarantee that what I say is absolute truth or that what I think may be the evolutionary path over the next decade or two will, in fact, prove to be the actual path. I am extrapolating from the facts and from what l believe are the unmistakable trends at the present time. My opinion is informed, however, even though I stopped talking about what I was reasonably sure I understood in 1959 when l stopped being an active professor and started as a full-time administrator. I have been an intense observer and participant in the total higher educational scene for the past eighteen years, and especially for the past fourteen years. I served a three-year term on the Board of Directors of the American Council on Education and a three-year term on the Executive Committee of the Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges. I have participated actively in the affairs of the Association of American Universities. Recently I served two years as president of the Association of Colleges and Universities of the State of New York. Where my view is clouded, it may be from overexposure, from total immersion in the problems that concern us so much. I hope that you, with your greater degree of detachment, can take my views, derived from my total immersion, and put them in a perspective that will help you guide one of the country's preeminent institutions through the inevitable turbulence of the coming years. If I can help you clarify your own thoughts even a little, I will be satisfied. President A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard stated his views on the functioning of Harvard's governing board in a 1920 report. In it he said that even private education has a public character, that it must keep in touch with public needs, and must maintain access via men of affairs to means for attaining aims approved by the public; that teaching, like all public services, must have an administration including both expert and lay elements. (Laymen are necessary to inform experts about results expected, not the means to attain them.) The governing board, Lowell continued, must have final authority because it is the trustee for the public which, even for a 165 private university, determines its objectives. Trusteeship is the holding of a charter of public trust for an institution. That is your task, and it is that task which I am seeking to illuminate in this discussion. Trustees of universities such as Cornell are, in normal times, not merely custodians. They are builders charged with the responsibility to add on, to change constructively, to start. Today more than ever, they must be alert, they must preserve, they must protect, they must build. You as trustees, with your devotion to the cause of higher education as practiced at Cornell, and with your understand- ing of Cornell's unique nature, must be alert to the University/'s problems and the pressures against which it must be buttressed. An important aspect of being alert is being prepared for unforeseen change, for such change has been a mark mark of higher education in the last decade. The student disorders which swept our campuses in the 1960s came upon us suddenly. I visited Latin American universities frequently in the 1960s. In the early to mid-60s, I watched the student upheaval there with increasing interest but with considerable detachment because I knew such upheaval could never come to higher education in the United States. And then, sud-denly, there were Berkeley, Columbia, and Cornell. The rapidity with which financial problems descended on us is another example of sudden change. Within a three-month period in 1974, the tenor of the times and the financial posture of many institutions went from positive to negative. You must, therefore, be prepared for the unforeseen, the unanticipated. You must keep an ear to the educational rail, watch for warning signals, and feel the changes in the wind. When I consult my clouded crystal ball, the signs I see that concern me most and which should most concern the Board of Trustees of this University, are those related to the preservation of the trinity of pluralism, excellence with diversity, and independence. My mission is to help you preserve this trinity.",file:///Users/jaredmitovich/Downloads/Corson%20Legacy%20book%20reduced.pdf,Dale Corson,Male,9/5/69,3099,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Ithaca,NY,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",28,"INTRODUCTION It is not often that a university president gets a chance to tell a board of trustees where to go or, more exactly, where they should be going and what they should look for en route.

29,cor5,5/25/77,Cornell University,Remarks at Dinner Honoring President and Mrs. Corson,Remarks,Campus CT,"I stand here before you tonight somewhat unwillingly, and embarrassed. I'm embarrassed because, while I welcome a degree of appreciation as much as anyone, you've gone too far. However, since I'm here, and since you have been so kind, and since I know my future is behind me, I might as well relax and enjoy it. To paraphrase Adlai Stevenson, flattery is like smoking. It doesn't hurt you as long as you don't inhale. I've been treated so well during the past year that I now realize I should have resigned every year. I want first to say something about the University presidency as an institution, then give some advice to Dr. (Frank H. T.) Rhodes and finally make some purely personal comments. In my early days as president I was often asked how I liked my job. It always made me think of the story Abraham Lincoln told in reply to the same question. The story concerned the man who had been tarred and feathered and was being ridden out of town on a rail. Someone in the crowd yelled: ""How do you like it?"" The man on the rail replied: ""If it wasn't for the honor of the thing l'd prefer to walk."" Carl Becker reported that one of his Cornell colleagues viewed the president's chief function as being ""to obviate the difficulties created by his office"". One of the more perceptive commentators on the University presidency is Clark Kerr, himself at one time president of the University of California, a position he left rather precipitately a decade ago. He left the position, he said, the same way he assumed it: fired with enthusiasm. Kerr's most famous statement about his task as president was his description of the job: to provide sex for the undergraduates, parking for the faculty, and football for the alumni. I've succeeded more with some of these duties than I have with others. When Herman Hickman was appointed football coach at Yale many years ago, he said he would try to keep the alumni ""surly but not mutinous"". The president of the University of New Mexico is William Davis, who at one time, was head football coach at Colorado. He was coach in a year when Oklahoma beat Colorado, 62-0. On the following Monday morning, Colorado's president called Davis to his office to tell him that the alumni were getting restless about the football situation and to ask what he had to say for himself about the Oklahoma game. Davis's reply was, ""Thank God we were up for the game."" Clark Kerr spoke in a more serious manner about the University presidency in a lecture series at Harvard, the Godkin Lectures, in 1963. He said: ""The university president in the United States is expected to be a friend of the students; a colleague of the faculty; a good fellow with the alumni; a sound administrator with the trustees; a good speaker with the public; an astute bargainer with the foundations and the federal agencies; a politician with the state legislature; a friend of industry, labor and agriculture; a persuasive diplomat with donors; a champion of education generally; a supporter of the professions (particularly law and medicine); a spokesman to the press; a scholar in his own right; a public servant at the state and national levels; a devotee of opera and football equally; a decent human being; a good husband and father; an active member of the church. Above all, he must enjoy travelling in airplanes, eating his meals in public, and attending public ceremonies. No one can be all these things. Some succeed at being none. ""He should be firm, yet gentle; sensitive to others, insensitive to himself; look to the past and to the future, yet be firmly planted in the present; both visionary and sound; affable yet reflective; know the value of a dollar and realize that ideas cannot be bought; inspiring in his visions yet cautious in what he does; a man of principle yet able to make a deal; a man with broad perspective who will follow the details conscientiously; a good American, but ready to criticize the status quo fearlessly; a seeker of truth where the truth may not hurt too much; a source of public policy pronouncements when they do not reflect on his own institution. He should sound like a mouse at home and look like a lion abroad. He is one of the marginal men in a democratic society — of whom there are many others — on the margin of many groups, many ideas, many endeavors, many characteristics. He is a marginal man, but at the very center of the total process."" Those are Clark Kerr's words. In the light of those words I feel like Clement Attlee, whom Winston Churchill described as a modest man, because he had much to be modest about. A couple of years ago the Provost of Earlham College, Paul Lacey, suggested that the job description for a college or university presidency might read as follows: ""Wanted, character actor, with wide experience playing professorial roles. Should be six feet or taller, have slim athletic build, look good in tweeds and casual sport clothes. Some skill in tennis, squash, skiing helpful. Must be able to read aloud with deep conviction, memorize parts quickly, have good memory for names, faces, quotations from Shakespeare; enjoy touring. Some possibility of improvisational roles and ad lib performances after first year."" Speaking of Shakespeare, there's a quotation I have sought to use for 18 years. Having failed to find an opportunity I'll give it to you now, with no context at all. It's from Coriolanus and it refers to Ulysses's travels. ""You would be another Penelope; yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses's absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths."" I once spoke at a dinner honoring a newly elected university president and I gave him some advice about how to be a successful university president. In good conscience I can do no less for my successor, Frank Rhodes. So here are some principles that l've developed from years of experience in trying to persuade others to do as I think they should do instead of as they think they should do. I'm quick to admit that, in formulating these principles, I've borrowed frequently and shamelessly from others. 1. Corson's Lemma. This is a derivative of Parkinson's first law. It states that the work will expand until it is 50 per cent greater than that which can be completed in the time available for its accomplishment. You might as well get used to this idea and decide what you will leave undone. 2. The Principle of Bases and Fences. This says that it takes less time to touch bases than it does to mend fences. 3. The Principle of the Impossibility of Solution. Many problems, if not most, are impossible to solve. All one can do is to resolve the issues. The best advice is: when in doubt, do the right thing. 4. The Golden Rule. Never forget the Golden Rule. This is a simple statement that says: whoever has the gold makes the rules. I call your attention to Corson's Corollary to this rule, however: make sure you have the gold. 5. The Principle of Necessary Evil. In order to maintain a degree of humility and to see yourself as others see you, look in the mirror every morning and say, ""I'm an evil, but am I a necessary one?"" 6. The Principle of Equal and Opposite Unpopularity. If you're equally unpopular, but for different reasons, with all parties to a dis-pute, you've probably found an appropriate resolution of the problem. If everyone is unhappy with you for the same reason, or if everyone is happy with you for the same reason, you've probably done the wrong thing. 7. The Principle of Appreciated Cost. It always costs more than they say it will. 8. The Principle of Controlled Boldness. Gamble. Be bold. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Take a look around you occasionally, however. It's like the three rules for courting a woman. The first rule is: be bold. The second rule is: be bold. The third rule is: don't be too bold. 9. The Principle of Success in Intercollegiate Athletics. I've tried for years to discover this principle but I've not been entirely success-ful. I think the principle is probably: find a good coach and pray. With these principles in mind, there's no reason why you shouldn't sleep like a baby; that is, sleep for an hour and then wake and cry for an hour. I also want to remind Dr. Rhodes about an ancient maxim concerning trustees (that I read somewhere) and then advise him about his inauguration. The maxim says that ""the trustee is like a small boy's definition of a lie — an abomination unto the Lord but a very present help in time of trouble. In 1969 there were two fashions for university presidential inaugurations. In one fashion the new president was inaugurated the same day he was elected. That way he was sure to be around for the inauguration. In the other fashion the inauguration was postponed for a year so that if the new president didn't last out the year, no time was wasted on formalities. In my case, we chose the second fashion. Actually, I was never inaugurated. Instead there was an investiture at Commencement following my first year in office. It was a great day. There were demonstrations and disruptions and two attempts to take over the microphone. Morris Bishop made international news when he bent the mace jabbing the protestors in the appropriate places. Those were the good old days! The high point of the occasion, however, was my introduction as the eighth president of the United States, which put me in a terrible spot. Not only did I not have the inaugural address of the eighth president of the United States with me, I didn't even know who the eighth president was. I thought it was Andrew Jackson but he proved to be the seventh. It's on this matter of the president of the United States that I want to advise Dr. Rhodes. If he's introduced as the ninth president of the United States I want him to be prepared. The ninth president was William Henry Harrison, and I had intended to have a copy of his inaugural address to give Dr. Rhodes, but there's a problem. Harrison spoke for an hour and 40 minutes. Now, we have a ""war on waste"" and my conscience won't let me use the volume of paper required to reproduce a 100-minute speech. I see no solution except for Dr. Rhodes to go to the library and memorize the speech. There are some other aspects of the Harrison inauguration which Dr. Rhodes should note carefully. Harrison wore no coat or hat when he gave his marathon speech and as a result he developed pneumonia and died precisely one month after the inauguration. There are some lessons here. I advise Dr. Rhodes to postpone the inauguration as long as possible and I advise him to wear a hat and coat when he gives his address. Now we come to the personal comments. When we came to Cornell in 1946, we had no ambition to be president of the University or of anything else. Fate, of course, plays a large part in the way anyone is propelled into a role such as the one l've played the last eight years. In the first place, we more or less tossed coins in deciding whether to come to Cornell or go to the University of Michigan or go to the Bell Telephone Laborato-ries. When I became chairman of the Physics Department in 1956, I was probably the logical choice for the job, although accepting it involved an anguishing decision. There was no logic at all in my choice as dean of the Engineering College. I was a last minute substitute after the prime candidate, whom I had helped recruit, withdrew. If President Perkins had been a physical scientist instead of a social scientist, I would never have been provost. If there had been no trouble in 1969, I would never have been president. But here I am. I could produce evidence to suggest that I haven't performed the job as well as some might have expected. For instance, in 1938 A. Lawrence Lowell, who was president of Harvard for a long time in the early years of this century, published a book in which he wrote: ""A university president should never feel hurried, or have the sense of working under pressure, for such things interfere gravely with the serenity of judgment he should always retain.... If he feels overworked it is because he does not know how to delegate work to others ... he has not learned that his business is thinking, not routine."" I may have retained many things, but serenity is not one of them. Perhaps if President Lowell had lived half a century later he might have written a different book. I want to say a word about my wife's role the last eight years. Her life has been committed to, has been consumed by, the University fully as much as mine has, and I'm pleased that you have recognized her tonight also. She's lived through all the same troubles that I've lived through and she's supported and encouraged me in all my ups and downs during these difficult years. In addition, she has had the disadvantage of being separated from the immediate scene and so has not known what was going on from minute to minute and hour to hour. One of the amusing events, one of the few amusing events, which occurred during the most difficult days happened when she was driving through the campus one day and saw a huge crowd outside Day Hall. Disturbed at what new trouble had erupted, she sought out the nearest phone and called my office. When there was no answer, she knew the worst had happened again and called the Safety Division to find out what it was. She learned that a routine fire drill was in progress. A few years ago we were guests of the British Commonwealth Association of Universities at their quinquennial Congress in Edin-burgh. Following Edinburgh, there was a special session for several days just for the vice chancellors and their presidential guests at Exeter. There one session was devoted to the problems of the wives of vice chancellors. A wife of one of the Australians spoke and she explained that the reason there was no woman vice chancellor in the Commonwealth was because in that case there would be no wife to accomplish the other half of the job. She also explained that she spent half her time pretending not to know about things that she did know about and the other half pretending to know about things she did not know about. I want to acknowledge the debt I owe my wife for all that she has done to support me and for all that she has suffered through the past eight years. The opportunity to be at Cornell has been a great privilege for us. The opportunity to associate with, and be part of, a faculty of the quality we have at Cornell; the opportunity to teach students of the ability we have at Cornell; the opportunity to count as friends the hundreds, the thousands of supportive alumni we've come to know; the opportunity to work with a Board of Trustees with the ability and the dedication of the Cornell Board; the opportunity to work with an administrative staff and a University work force of such dedication, and in many cases, of such uncommon ability, as Cornell has; the opportunity to live in a physical setting of such natural beauty — these have all been privileges of the highest order, and we're grateful. I'm grateful particularly for the support of the Board of Trustees during my years as President, and l ask that you support Frank Rhodes as you have supported me. Although we've been at Cornell for 31 years, we don't propose to end our association now. Our position is similar to that of a State of Maine native who was asked by a summer visitor, ""You lived here all your life?"" The Mainer replied, ""Not yet."" In our years at Cornell we have experienced the exhilaration of extraordinary achievement by faculty colleagues, by students, by athletic teams. We have experienced the exhilaration of Nobel Prizes and National Book Awards. We have experienced the exhilaration of Commencement in Schoellkopf on a glorious spring day. We have also known the sorrow, the terrible empty sorrow, of brilliant lives ended too soon, of young lives lost before their promise ever bloomed, of tragedy thrust on us from every direction. Perhaps we, more than most, have felt these sorrows because our lives, more than most, have been interwoven with the life of the whole University. Between Uris Library and Morrill Hall, on that beautiful place Goldwin Smith called ""the platform overhanging the lake"", there's a stone bench placed there by Andrew D. White and his second wife, in 1892. While the circumstances were quite different, the words carved on that bench reflect the joys and sorrows we've known at Cornell: ""To those who shall sit here rejoicing, To those who shall sit here mourning, Sympathy and greeting So have we done in our time."" Concerning success in life, I think it was Ralph Waldo Emerson who once wrote: ""To laugh often and love much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the approbation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to give of one's self; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived — this is to have succeeded."" We've not done a great deal of singing with exultation, but we hope there are lives who have breathed easier because we've lived. For having enriched our lives beyond our ability ever to repay, thank you.",file:///Users/jaredmitovich/Downloads/Corson%20Legacy%20book%20reduced.pdf,Dale Corson,Male,9/5/69,2819,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Ithaca,NY,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",29,"I stand here before you tonight somewhat unwillingly, and embarrassed. I'm embarrassed because, while I welcome a degree of appreciation as much as anyone, you've gone too far. However, since I'm here, and since you have been so kind, and since I know my future is behind me, I might as well relax and enjoy it. To paraphrase Adlai Stevenson, flattery is like smoking. It doesn't hurt you as long as you don't inhale. I've been treated so well during the past year that I now realize I should have resigned every year. I want first to say something about the University presidency as an institution, then give some advice to Dr. (Frank H. T.) Rhodes and finally make some purely personal comments. In my early days as president I was often asked how I liked my job. It always made me think of the story Abraham Lincoln told in reply to the same question. The story concerned the man who had been tarred and feathered and was being ridden out of town on a rail. Someone in the crowd yelled: ""How do you like it?"" The man on the rail replied: ""If it wasn't for the honor of the thing l'd prefer to walk."" Carl Becker reported that one of his Cornell colleagues viewed the president's chief function as being ""to obviate the difficulties created by his office"". One of the more perceptive commentators on the University presidency is Clark Kerr, himself at one time president of the University of California, a position he left rather precipitately a decade ago. He left the position, he said, the same way he assumed it: fired with enthusiasm. Kerr's most famous statement about his task as president was his description of the job: to provide sex for the undergraduates, parking for the faculty, and football for the alumni. I've succeeded more with some of these duties than I have with others. When Herman Hickman was appointed football coach at Yale many years ago, he said he would try to keep the alumni ""surly but not mutinous"". The president of the University of New Mexico is William Davis, who at one time, was head football coach at Colorado. He was coach in a year when Oklahoma beat Colorado, 62-0. On the following Monday morning, Colorado's president called Davis to his office to tell him that the alumni were getting restless about the football situation and to ask what he had to say for himself about the Oklahoma game. Davis's reply was, ""Thank God we were up for the game."" Clark Kerr spoke in a more serious manner about the University presidency in a lecture series at Harvard, the Godkin Lectures, in 1963. He said: ""The university president in the United States is expected to be a friend of the students; a colleague of the faculty; a good fellow with the alumni; a sound administrator with the trustees; a good speaker with the public; an astute bargainer with the foundations and the federal agencies; a politician with the state legislature; a friend of industry, labor and agriculture; a persuasive diplomat with donors; a champion of education generally; a supporter of the professions (particularly law and medicine); a spokesman to the press; a scholar in his own right; a public servant at the state and national levels; a devotee of opera and football equally; a decent human being; a good husband and father; an active member of the church. Above all, he must enjoy travelling in airplanes, eating his meals in public, and attending public ceremonies. No one can be all these things. Some succeed at being none. ""He should be firm, yet gentle; sensitive to others, insensitive to himself; look to the past and to the future, yet be firmly planted in the present; both visionary and sound; affable yet reflective; know the value of a dollar and realize that ideas cannot be bought; inspiring in his visions yet cautious in what he does; a man of principle yet able to make a deal; a man with broad perspective who will follow the details conscientiously; a good American, but ready to criticize the status quo fearlessly; a seeker of truth where the truth may not hurt too much; a source of public policy pronouncements when they do not reflect on his own institution. He should sound like a mouse at home and look like a lion abroad. He is one of the marginal men in a democratic society — of whom there are many others — on the margin of many groups, many ideas, many endeavors, many characteristics. He is a marginal man, but at the very center of the total process."" Those are Clark Kerr's words. In the light of those words I feel like Clement Attlee, whom Winston Churchill described as a modest man, because he had much to be modest about. A couple of years ago the Provost of Earlham College, Paul Lacey, suggested that the job description for a college or university presidency might read as follows: ""Wanted, character actor, with wide experience playing professorial roles. Should be six feet or taller, have slim athletic build, look good in tweeds and casual sport clothes. Some skill in tennis, squash, skiing helpful. Must be able to read aloud with deep conviction, memorize parts quickly, have good memory for names, faces, quotations from Shakespeare; enjoy touring. Some possibility of improvisational roles and ad lib performances after first year."" Speaking of Shakespeare, there's a quotation I have sought to use for 18 years. Having failed to find an opportunity I'll give it to you now, with no context at all. It's from Coriolanus and it refers to Ulysses's travels. ""You would be another Penelope; yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses's absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths."" I once spoke at a dinner honoring a newly elected university president and I gave him some advice about how to be a successful university president. In good conscience I can do no less for my successor, Frank Rhodes. So here are some principles that l've developed from years of experience in trying to persuade others to do as I think they should do instead of as they think they should do. I'm quick to admit that, in formulating these principles, I've borrowed frequently and shamelessly from others. 1. Corson's Lemma. This is a derivative of Parkinson's first law. It states that the work will expand until it is 50 per cent greater than that which can be completed in the time available for its accomplishment. You might as well get used to this idea and decide what you will leave undone. 2. The Principle of Bases and Fences. This says that it takes less time to touch bases than it does to mend fences. 3. The Principle of the Impossibility of Solution. Many problems, if not most, are impossible to solve. All one can do is to resolve the issues. The best advice is: when in doubt, do the right thing. 4. The Golden Rule. Never forget the Golden Rule. This is a simple statement that says: whoever has the gold makes the rules. I call your attention to Corson's Corollary to this rule, however: make sure you have the gold. 5. The Principle of Necessary Evil. In order to maintain a degree of humility and to see yourself as others see you, look in the mirror every morning and say, ""I'm an evil, but am I a necessary one?"" 6. The Principle of Equal and Opposite Unpopularity. If you're equally unpopular, but for different reasons, with all parties to a dis-pute, you've probably found an appropriate resolution of the problem. If everyone is unhappy with you for the same reason, or if everyone is happy with you for the same reason, you've probably done the wrong thing. 7. The Principle of Appreciated Cost. It always costs more than they say it will. 8. The Principle of Controlled Boldness. Gamble. Be bold. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Take a look around you occasionally, however. It's like the three rules for courting a woman. The first rule is: be bold. The second rule is: be bold. The third rule is: don't be too bold. 9. The Principle of Success in Intercollegiate Athletics. I've tried for years to discover this principle but I've not been entirely success-ful. I think the principle is probably: find a good coach and pray. With these principles in mind, there's no reason why you shouldn't sleep like a baby; that is, sleep for an hour and then wake and cry for an hour. I also want to remind Dr. Rhodes about an ancient maxim concerning trustees (that I read somewhere) and then advise him about his inauguration. The maxim says that ""the trustee is like a small boy's definition of a lie — an abomination unto the Lord but a very present help in time of trouble. In 1969 there were two fashions for university presidential inaugurations. In one fashion the new president was inaugurated the same day he was elected. That way he was sure to be around for the inauguration. In the other fashion the inauguration was postponed for a year so that if the new president didn't last out the year, no time was wasted on formalities. In my case, we chose the second fashion. Actually, I was never inaugurated. Instead there was an investiture at Commencement following my first year in office. It was a great day. There were demonstrations and disruptions and two attempts to take over the microphone. Morris Bishop made international news when he bent the mace jabbing the protestors in the appropriate places. Those were the good old days! The high point of the occasion, however, was my introduction as the eighth president of the United States, which put me in a terrible spot. Not only did I not have the inaugural address of the eighth president of the United States with me, I didn't even know who the eighth president was. I thought it was Andrew Jackson but he proved to be the seventh. It's on this matter of the president of the United States that I want to advise Dr. Rhodes. If he's introduced as the ninth president of the United States I want him to be prepared. The ninth president was William Henry Harrison, and I had intended to have a copy of his inaugural address to give Dr. Rhodes, but there's a problem. Harrison spoke for an hour and 40 minutes. Now, we have a ""war on waste"" and my conscience won't let me use the volume of paper required to reproduce a 100-minute speech. I see no solution except for Dr. Rhodes to go to the library and memorize the speech. There are some other aspects of the Harrison inauguration which Dr. Rhodes should note carefully. Harrison wore no coat or hat when he gave his marathon speech and as a result he developed pneumonia and died precisely one month after the inauguration. There are some lessons here. I advise Dr. Rhodes to postpone the inauguration as long as possible and I advise him to wear a hat and coat when he gives his address. Now we come to the personal comments. When we came to Cornell in 1946, we had no ambition to be president of the University or of anything else. Fate, of course, plays a large part in the way anyone is propelled into a role such as the one l've played the last eight years. In the first place, we more or less tossed coins in deciding whether to come to Cornell or go to the University of Michigan or go to the Bell Telephone Laborato-ries. When I became chairman of the Physics Department in 1956, I was probably the logical choice for the job, although accepting it involved an anguishing decision. There was no logic at all in my choice as dean of the Engineering College. I was a last minute substitute after the prime candidate, whom I had helped recruit, withdrew. If President Perkins had been a physical scientist instead of a social scientist, I would never have been provost. If there had been no trouble in 1969, I would never have been president. But here I am. I could produce evidence to suggest that I haven't performed the job as well as some might have expected. For instance, in 1938 A. Lawrence Lowell, who was president of Harvard for a long time in the early years of this century, published a book in which he wrote: ""A university president should never feel hurried, or have the sense of working under pressure, for such things interfere gravely with the serenity of judgment he should always retain.... If he feels overworked it is because he does not know how to delegate work to others ... he has not learned that his business is thinking, not routine."" I may have retained many things, but serenity is not one of them. Perhaps if President Lowell had lived half a century later he might have written a different book. I want to say a word about my wife's role the last eight years. Her life has been committed to, has been consumed by, the University fully as much as mine has, and I'm pleased that you have recognized her tonight also. She's lived through all the same troubles that I've lived through and she's supported and encouraged me in all my ups and downs during these difficult years. In addition, she has had the disadvantage of being separated from the immediate scene and so has not known what was going on from minute to minute and hour to hour. One of the amusing events, one of the few amusing events, which occurred during the most difficult days happened when she was driving through the campus one day and saw a huge crowd outside Day Hall. Disturbed at what new trouble had erupted, she sought out the nearest phone and called my office. When there was no answer, she knew the worst had happened again and called the Safety Division to find out what it was. She learned that a routine fire drill was in progress. A few years ago we were guests of the British Commonwealth Association of Universities at their quinquennial Congress in Edin-burgh. Following Edinburgh, there was a special session for several days just for the vice chancellors and their presidential guests at Exeter. There one session was devoted to the problems of the wives of vice chancellors. A wife of one of the Australians spoke and she explained that the reason there was no woman vice chancellor in the Commonwealth was because in that case there would be no wife to accomplish the other half of the job. She also explained that she spent half her time pretending not to know about things that she did know about and the other half pretending to know about things she did not know about. I want to acknowledge the debt I owe my wife for all that she has done to support me and for all that she has suffered through the past eight years.

31,ptn1,9/15/86,Princeton University,At a Slight Angle to the World,Remarks,Political CT,"Today, with these exercises in this Chapel, we begin the 240th year for Princeton, By long tradition, the remarks of the President are directed mainly to the entering students, and on this occasion I wish to explore with you the nature of the University itself -- and, more specifically, Its relationship to the society it seeks to serve. I want to begin by contrasting the openness and independence of the University you are entering with the much more authoritarian character of higher education in other times and places. If you had attended Princeton a century ago, the faculty who taught you would have been chosen, at least in part, on the basis of their religious beliefs as well as their competence as teachers and scholars. You would have found that there were real limits to the range of opinions thought acceptable. Colleges and universities in this country today enjoy a degree of autonomy, and especially of freedom from the application of political as well as religious tests, that is almost unique when viewed historically or when compared with universities right now in most other parts of the world. The treatment of the Chinese universities during the Cultural Revolution is the most extreme recent example of ideological domination of higher education. I was in the People's Republic of China in 1974, after the start of efforts to resuscitate the universities, and even then, when I asked one university president to identify his principal problem, he was quick to respond: ""Getting the faculty to think right."" In Chile, immediately following the coup of 1973, the universities were purged of known Marxists and put under the control of military rectors. One of the many faculty members subsequently dismissed had committed the ""crime"" of producing research criti-cal of government figures on economic growth and income distribution. By that test, economics departments in this country would be depopulated overnight! The Greek universities suffered severely under the juntas from 1967 to 1974; and then, when civilian rule was restored, militant students called for ""catharsis"" -- the purging of professors who had collaborated with the military dictatorship. They denounced as well, it was reported in the New York Times, ""professors they considered too conservative politically or too strict academically."" Many other examples could be cited to demonstrate that even democratic forms of government often provide no assurance of freedom for universities from ideological intervention. In all universities, at all times, the same fundamental questions have to be answered. On the basis of what criteria are students and faculty to be chosen? What subject matter should be taught and studied? Should one or many points of view be presented? Who should decide what are the ""right"" answers to controversial questions? In short, what educational philosophy should be followed? And, how should society exercise its strong and altogether legitimate interest in the way universities function? You will not expect me (I hope!) to provide anything purporting to be comprehensive answers to those large questions today. I will try only to give you some sense of how responses have changed over time, and some understanding of the principles that underlie how this University -- now your University -- seeks to serve the societal purposes for which it was chartered. Underlying all else is of course the values of the society itself. A distinguished faculty member of ours, Professor Bernard Lewis, has recently published a brilliant book called The Jews of Islam in which he describes the interactions between these two religious traditions over nearly thirteen centuries. Early on he observes that ""...tolerance is a new virtue, intolerance a new crime... Until comparatively modern times, Christian Europe neither prized nor practiced tolerance itself, and was not greatly offended by its absence in others. The charge that was always brought against Islam was not that its doctrines were imposed by force -- something seen as normal and natural -- but that its doctrines were false."" A reading of Richard Hofstadter and Walter Metzger's classic history of the development of academic freedom in the United States, with its European roots, underscores the relevance of Professor Lewis' observation for universities. Whereas it is common today simply to assume the right of free inquiry, the driving assumption throughout most of history has been a very different one. The medieval academic community, for instance, while self-governing in many respects, took for granted ""the right of some authority to exercise censorship and proscription in theology and on such conclusions of philosophy as were deemed to encroach upon theology."" Heretics were expelled -- and some-times burned. In America, the struggles for religious tolerance and academic freedom were closely entwined. Both were affected profoundly in the second half of the 19th century by the work of Charles Darwin and, more generally, by the growing acceptance of the scientific method. The ensuing debates over doctrine and the nature of Truth itself were often exceedingly painful. American universities were also affected powerfully by the impressive accomplishments of the German universities and by the growing interest in higher education of the federal and state governments, as reflected in the establishment of the land-grant universities. Private universities were of course particularly susceptible to pressures from their own constituents. The increasing generosity of individuals of means meant that colleges and universities were beginning to be subject to the strong will of donors. A famous case of this kind occurred at Stanford when, in 1900, an outspoken critic of big business, Professor Edward A. Ross, was forced to resign at the direct instigation of Mrs. Stanford herself. The tensions associated with World War I affected many campuses, including this one, as I learned just this spring through a profile in the Princeton Alumni Weekly of an extraordinary alumnus of ours, Henry Strater '19. Strater, a pacifist as an undergraduate, joined with several other students to bring the most famous anti-war personality of the time, William Jennings Bryan, to speak at Princeton. Mr. Strater offers this recollec-tion: ""The president of Princeton called me into his office when he found out about Bryan. President Hibben said that he couldn't allow Bryan to speak on campus because he had already committed Princeton to a war policy. Eventually we were able to have Bryan speak at a little church that adjoined the campus, and he spoke to a full house."" Ahistorical as so many of us are these days, we may forget that the famous statement on academic freedom adopted by the American Association of University Professors and subsequently endorsed by many educational associations was not drafted until 1915, was not endorsed by the American Council on Education until 1925, and was not approved in its final form until 1940. And then, of course, the sad legacy of the McCarthy period in America in the early 1950's is a forceful reminder of how easy it seems to be, even in the second half of the twentieth century, to slip back into efforts at thought control. Let me now move to the present and outline as briefly as I can the philosophy and policies that guide us today, the reasons for them, and what I believe is required if they are to be kept secure. Princeton's obligations to society are to educate students for responsible citizenship and to advance the frontiers of knowledge. The educational philosophy adopted to achieve these goals has three principal roots: first, an unqualified commitment to the most vigorous possible search for truth in all of its cultural, spiritual, social, and physical manifestations; second, a belief that openness to conflicting viewpoints and free debate 1s central to this search; and, third, a faith in the individual and a corresponding insistence on the importance of fostering independent thinking. Implicit in this educational philosophy is acknowledgment of the ever-present possibility of being wrong, a willingness to change one's mind, and an ability to respect viewpoints other than one's own -- in short, a reasonable degree of intellectual as well as personal humility. It is salutary to remember the number of errors and even crimes that have been committed in the names of Truth and Conscience. For many years, one of the faculty members at Princeton who most successfully challenged students and faculty alike to reexamine their assumptions and confront their prejudices was H. H. Wilson of the Politics Department. Professor Wilson once described education as ""the opposite of indoctrination."" He explained: ""In all societies efforts are made to use the schools for indoctrination, to propagandize, to inculcate beliefs, to produce cheerleaders for the status quo. Learning how to think is a wholly different operation from being told what to think… The teacher expresses respect for the student; the indoctrinator holds the student in contempt."" This is not to say that Princeton abjures efforts to distinguish right from wrong, truth from falsehood, but rather that it believes, with John Milton, that given an opportunity, truth and right will eventually triumph over falsehood and wrong. Viewed against either the norm today worldwide or even against our own recent past in this country, the concept of education that I have just outlined is a very radical one: teachers and students alike are to be permitted -- and, in some sense, even encouraged -- to be critical of the very individuals, organizations, and agencies that are providing their sustenance. It is certainly not hard to understand why anyone in a position of authority would be tempted to use educational institutions to indoctrinate, to insist that they hew to the party line, to be sure that faculty ""think right."" Indeed, the interesting question is the opposite one: what accounts for the rather hip! peculiar willingness of our society to support institutions that can be the home of so much contrariness? There are, I think, two explanations. First, we are fortunate to live in a country in which democratic values predominate; in which a Constitution and its ""Bill of Rights"" protect dissenters. The second explanation is more practical but no less important. The freedom to think freshly, and for one's self. is essential to deeper understanding of all subjects, to scientific and technological progress, and to the full development of the capacities of our people. In short, teaching and research are done better when they are unfettered than when ideological constraints are applied, and the society has a very pragmatic interest in the quality of a place like Princeton. What is required of us if this philosophy of openness 18 to be sustained? I would like to suggest four elements that, working together, seem to me to constitute the essential foundation for the independence of the University and the effective exercise of freedom within it. First is clarity on our part concerning our mission and integrity in carrying it out. This includes an unwillingness, especially in recruiting and promoting faculty, to subordinate the single-minded pursuit of excellence and integrity to anything else. Cronyism or favoritism of any kind (related to friendship, to shared political sympathies, to religious affiliation, or even to the apparent advantages of ""comfortable"" relationships within a department) have no place in the appointment process. Second is an unwillingness to be ""bought."" Governments and private donors alike must understand that support cannot be conditioned on ideological conformity. The University is not for sale. Furthermore, to allow such assertions of independence to be powerful realities, the University must have flexible resources of its own. Inevitably, and with the greatest regard for the ""not-for-sale"" principle, many funds provided to the University will reflect the greater interests of grant-making entities and other donors in some aspects of the University's mission than in others. Accordingly, the University must have the funds to achieve at least some balance in its activities and to retain, finally, the capacity to determine what kind of place it is to be. As someone once said: ""To be great, an institution must be free; and to be free, it must be solvent."" Third, the University as an institution must exercise a 51g-nificant degree of institutional restraint if its individual members are to enjoy the maximum degree of freedom. This seeming paradox is somewhat complex, and I want to take a few minutes to explore its ramifications. The idea that the university as an institution should consciously distance itself somewhat from the political and social conflicts of the day developed only in this century, and as a concomitant with greater academic freedom for faculty and stu-dents. From medieval times through the early 1900's, it was normal for universities in their institutional capacities to serve as defenders and propagandists of the official religious and political systems, and for administrators, faculty and students to be expected to support these positions. This earlier pattern emphasized more institutional involvement in the outside world, and less individual freedom of expression. Religious, political, and intellectual radicals have always found refuge in the interstices of the university, but until very recently they have often been liable to discrimination and expulsion. The relatively recent reversal of this relationship -- restrain-ng collective university positions on issues of public policy out expanding the range of individual opinions -- has proved to be critically important in the building of modern research universities with the highest academic standards. Institutional restraint, then, has been an essential corollary to the strengthening of freedom of expression for individuals. The reluctance of universities to take institutional stands on issues has not stemmed from indifference, from any sense of being in a privileged position ""above the fray,"" or from any lack of awareness that all the institutions of the society are implicated in its imperfections and should seek to avoid adding to them. Rather, this reluctance has been viewed as a positive thing: a direct demonstration of the institutions' openness to all points of view. Internally, the absence of an institutional statement of ""orthodoxy"" lessens the risk that faculty or students will be favored in some way -- or will think that they may be favored -- by taking the ""right"" position on a controversial question. In fact, the more agreement within the University there is on a particular issue of political or social policy, the more important it may be not to take an institutional position. That is because a key obligation of the University is protection of The relatively recent reversal of this relationship -- restraining collective university positions on issues of public policy but expanding the range of individual opinions -- has proved to be critically important in the building of modern research universities with the highest academic standards. Institutional restraint, then, has been an essential corollary to the strengthening of freedom of expression for individuals. The reluctance of universities to take institutional stands on issues has not stemmed from indifference, from any sense of being in a privileged position ""above the fray,"" or from any lack of awareness that all the institutions of the society are implicated in its imperfections and should seek to avoid adding to them.

In fact, the more agreement within the University there is on a particular issue of political or social policy, the more important it may be not to take an institutional position. That is because a key obligation of the University is protection of minority viewpoints, and such protection is needed especially when the minority feels itself beleaguered. This point was made -- though not always successfully -- in the later stages of the Vietnam War when the people on campus who often felt most oppressed were the small group in favor of U.S, policy. It is very important that we do nothing that might, in H. H. Wilson's phrase, ""drive disagreement under cover."" While it is essential that individuals within the University have the freedom to be as frank as they wish to be in expressing unpopular opinions, it is equally important that the society accept expressions of belief by individuals that many will see as ""outrages"" without punishing the University itself. Defending provocative points of view can be done most credibly when the institution itself has a reputation for evenhandedness and impartiality. Those outside the university who would like to see faculty appointed on the basis of certain beliefs, or courses offered to support particular ideologies, are more readily dissuaded when the University can point to its own restraint on ideological and political questions. It is inevitable that the University as an institution will enrage from time to time one or another powerful interest or constituency. If it is a place of integrity, it will do so simply by defending the very forms of freedom that we have been con-sidering. The University must also speak strongly, and, if need be, act politically, if its central mission or Independence is threatened. In short, the University must never fear controversy; but its willingness to be contentious should grow directly out of its educational responsibilities and be consistent with them. Institutional restraint is an expression of institutional tolerance, and it is unfortunately true that tolerance is often regarded as a lowest common denominator kind of value, important only to those who don't care very much anyway or who are afraid to take positions for fear of offending someone. ""Doesn't the University believe in anything?"" is a question sometimes raised. The answer is a resounding ""Yes."" This is a value-laden insti-tution, and it is for that reason that I avoid using the word ""neutrality"" to describe its aims, even in areas outside the academic. But the University's core values emanate from its character as a university. In this setting, the unrelenting. open-minded search for truth is itself the highest value; it is not to be sacrificed to anything else. It is one thing for the University to espouse central human values, including freedom of inquiry and respect for the rights and dignity of each person. It is quite another for the University as an institution to advocate particular political strategies. That is a task for each of us, as Richard Hofstadter explained so well at the Columbia Commencement of 1968 when he said: ""...While I hope I am speaking in the interest of my university, it would be wrong to suggest that 1 am precisely speaking for it. It is in fact of the very essence of the conception of the modern university that ... no one is authorized to speak for it.... It does not have corporate views of public questions... This fact of our all speaking separately is in itself a thing of great consequence, because in this age of rather overwhelming organizations and collectivities, the university is singular in being a collectivity that serves as a citadel of intellectual individualism."" Fourth and last on my list of elements necessary to the effective carrying out of our philosophy of openness is what I would call simply a good temper on the campus, and among those off the campus who care about Princeton. The issues I have been discussing -- and many others -- stir the passions. We will argue mightily about them. We should. Indeed, our openness virtually guarantees disputes and perhaps even conflicts among us. But we must conduct ourselves, and our debates, with the same spirit of open-mindedness and with the same commitment to close reasoning that should be evident in our academic undertakings. We should be calm in our disagreements, generous in our imputations of motives, and respectful of the institution itself. Civility, good humor, and a capacity for sustaining friendships in spite of disagreements, are important values in all institutional cultures. They are absolutely indispensable in this one. Otherwise, pluralism can collapse into anarchy, and the very educational values we are here to celebrate will be jeopardized. This kind of university is poised delicately between what Professor Hofstadter described as ""its position in the external world, with all its corruption and evils and cruelties, and the splendid world of our imagination."" It stands, as someone once said of the poet Cavafy, ""at a slight angle to the world."" It has clear responsibilities to the society, but it discharges them in important degree by means that are sometimes as likely to provoke as to reassure. The modern university is a unique entity, fundamentally different from agencies of government, from churches, businesses, labor organizations, political par-ties, and social clubs. Far more than any of these, it flourishes by maintaining a climate of freedom. It is up to each of you to exercise this hard-won freedom, to experience the joys as well as the frustrations of opening yourselves to new ideas, but without forgetting that you need to remain rooted in the values that give meaning to your lives. Only as you put your sturdiest qualities to work on behalf of others, in the service of those commitments and shared efforts that will do so much to shape the world, will the restraints and other obligations that the University accepts achieve their full value. I welcome you most warmly to this peculiar -- this very special -- community. It is a place worthy of your best efforts.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdTID9apTKEye_7GM4jPdpkcVgVBEUA0qOCPuZa-mvc/edit?tab=t.a0tr9twefbmo,William Bowen,Male,1/30/72,5342,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Princeton,NJ,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",31,"Today, with these exercises in this Chapel, we begin the 240th year for Princeton, By long tradition, the remarks of the President are directed mainly to the entering students, and on this occasion I wish to explore with you the nature of the University itself -- and, more specifically, Its relationship to the society it seeks to serve. I want to begin by contrasting the openness and independence of the University you are entering with the much more authoritarian character of higher education in other times and places. If you had attended Princeton a century ago, the faculty who taught you would have been chosen, at least in part, on the basis of their religious beliefs as well as their competence as teachers and scholars. You would have found that there were real limits to the range of opinions thought acceptable. Colleges and universities in this country today enjoy a degree of autonomy, and especially of freedom from the application of political as well as religious tests, that is almost unique when viewed historically or when compared with universities right now in most other parts of the world. The treatment of the Chinese universities during the Cultural Revolution is the most extreme recent example of ideological domination of higher education. I was in the People's Republic of China in 1974, after the start of efforts to resuscitate the universities, and even then, when I asked one university president to identify his principal problem, he was quick to respond: ""Getting the faculty to think right."" In Chile, immediately following the coup of 1973, the universities were purged of known Marxists and put under the control of military rectors. One of the many faculty members subsequently dismissed had committed the ""crime"" of producing research criti-cal of government figures on economic growth and income distribution. By that test, economics departments in this country would be depopulated overnight! The Greek universities suffered severely under the juntas from 1967 to 1974; and then, when civilian rule was restored, militant students called for ""catharsis"" -- the purging of professors who had collaborated with the military dictatorship. They denounced as well, it was reported in the New York Times, ""professors they considered too conservative politically or too strict academically."" Many other examples could be cited to demonstrate that even democratic forms of government often provide no assurance of freedom for universities from ideological intervention. In all universities, at all times, the same fundamental questions have to be answered. On the basis of what criteria are students and faculty to be chosen? What subject matter should be taught and studied? Should one or many points of view be presented? Who should decide what are the ""right"" answers to controversial questions? In short, what educational philosophy should be followed? And, how should society exercise its strong and altogether legitimate interest in the way universities function? You will not expect me (I hope!) to provide anything purporting to be comprehensive answers to those large questions today. I will try only to give you some sense of how responses have changed over time, and some understanding of the principles that underlie how this University -- now your University -- seeks to serve the societal purposes for which it was chartered. Underlying all else is of course the values of the society itself. A distinguished faculty member of ours, Professor Bernard Lewis, has recently published a brilliant book called The Jews of Islam in which he describes the interactions between these two religious traditions over nearly thirteen centuries. Early on he observes that ""...tolerance is a new virtue, intolerance a new crime... Until comparatively modern times, Christian Europe neither prized nor practiced tolerance itself, and was not greatly offended by its absence in others. The charge that was always brought against Islam was not that its doctrines were imposed by force -- something seen as normal and natural -- but that its doctrines were false."" A reading of Richard Hofstadter and Walter Metzger's classic history of the development of academic freedom in the United States, with its European roots, underscores the relevance of Professor Lewis' observation for universities. Whereas it is common today simply to assume the right of free inquiry, the driving assumption throughout most of history has been a very different one.

32,ptn2,5/7/85,Princeton University,Remarks by William G. Bowen on Forum on University Investments in Companies Doing any Part of their Business in South Africa,Remarks,Political CT,"I am pleased that the Council of the Princeton University Community is sponsoring this meeting, which has been called to give interested members of the University community an opportunity to hear directly the reasons for the University's current policies on investments in companies doing any part of their business in South Africa and to provide an opportunity for questions. A number of students, faculty members, and others have told me that they find aspects of the current debate perplexing, and I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify, as best I can, some of the underlying issues as seen from the perspective of the Trustees. This year, more than in some previous years, the focus of much of the discussion has been squarely on arguments for and against divestiture as a general approach, and I think we take fullest advantage of this gathering if we concentrate on that specific question rather than on other aspects of University policy (including the ways in which the University has sought to act as a responsible shareholder by encouraging companies to follow practices in South Africa that have seemed to offer the possibility of a constructive, if limited, impact). My starting point is a conundrum that we might all ponder: Given the widespread agreement among so many of us on the basic values -- the dignity of each human being, a revulsion at repression and violence, a commitment to building relationships among people that transcend race -- why are many of us nonetheless at such an impasse on the issue of divestiture? There are, I think, two parts to the answer. First, there are significant differences of opinion as to what policies toward South Africa provide the best chance of ending apartheid, and of doing so in a way that offers some hope of building a better society for all. The second, and in some ways more fundamental, answer is that what may be right action for an individual may not be right action for this kind of university. This key distinction dominated much of the discussion at the last meeting of the Board of Trustees, and I will come back to it several times in these remarks. Let me begin, however. by reiterating a central point of agreement: those of us who have participated in this debate within the Board and on the campus are, I believe, unanimous in our condemnation of apartheid. I cannot convey adequately how strongly the Trustees feel about this. Some of them have spent significant parts of their lives fighting for civil rights in this country and abroad, and a number have direct experience of South Africa. For me personally, apartheid is a violation of every principle of decency and of right relationships among people. To pile on adjectives is superfluous and even demeaning. The point is clear without embellishment. What is at issue, then, is not how we feel about apartheid. Nor is the issue what we should do about apartheid as individuals (even though there are obviously differences of opinion about that). What is at issue is what this University, as an educational institution, can and should do. To sharpen my own thinking, I have listed eight considerations that have led the Board of Trustees (with different Trustees naturally giving different weights to different consid-erations) to conclude that divestiture is not the right means, There are, I think, two parts to the answer. First, there are significant differences of opinion as to what policies toward South Africa provide the best chance of ending apartheid, and of doing so in a way that offers some hope of building a better society for all.

Nor is the issue what we should do about apartheid as individuals (even though there are obviously differences of opinion about that). What is at issue is what this University, as an educational institution, can and should do. To sharpen my own thinking, I have listed eight considerations that have led the Board of Trustees (with different Trustees naturally giving different weights to different consid-erations) to conclude that divestiture is not the right means, (major political change in South Africa), and the connections may not be nearly as tight as some assume. Quite apart from the fact that Princeton holds only a very small fraction of the stock of any of the companies in question, it is the experience of many of us that companies are much more responsive to reasoned argument, based on special knowledge or special competence, than to apparently dramatic actions of a once-and-for-all character that can be dismissed as bowing to local pressures and that, in any event, allow for no follow-through. 3. If part of the resistance to divestiture rests on serious doubts about one or the other of the two key premises just mentioned, another part rests on real reservations about arguments that relate to ""moral purity."" It is sometimes argued that, whatever the actual effects or lack of effects of divesti-ture, it is wrong in principle for the University to hold stock in a company that can be seen as in any degree participating or acquiescing in apartheid. Some Trustees reject this argument because they believe, as noted earlier, that the companies in question are more positive than negative in their actual impacts and are therefore acting in morally responsible ways. But other Trustees reject the moral purity argument on more general grounds. They believe that the quest for ""clean hands"" is an impossible one, in a world too full of imperfection, and that it can even lead to narrow, self-congratulatory acts that do not in fact address the full range of moral issues that need to be taken into account. There is, for example, the problem for the University of how to treat the many companies that sell products to South Africa -- or that buy from South Africa -- without actually having offices there. Are they less involved in the complicity that we would be seeking to avoid? Should not their stock be sold too? What about gifts that the University receives from this same, very large, set of companies -- or from the even larger number of individuals who hold their stock? It would be hard for many Trustees to justify requesting support for scholar-ships, professorships, or any other University needs from companies that have been found unacceptable as Investment vehicles on moral grounds. There is, in addition, the fact that the University uses products from these same companies. If we really wish to dissociate ourselves from IBM, for example, is it sufficient to sell IBM stock? Can we, in good conscience, simultaneously accept money from IBM for a professorship (as we have just done), or matching gifts that go into Annual Giving, or -- as we have also done recently -- computers used by faculty and students all across the campus? Please do not misunderstand me. I have great respect for those who are concerned about the moral issues presented here. Indeed, the moral issues are, for me, the most fundamental. But they are far from simple. From my point of view, actions taken on moral grounds are most credible when any negative consequences are felt directly by the individuals urging the actions, rather than by others now at Princeton who may have very different views as to the correct policy, or by still others, future students and faculty members, not even here yet. From this perspective, what should be the position of the current faculty and staff whose personal pension funds are invested in a large, national portfolio (TIAA-CREF) that holds vastly greater amounts of stock in these same companies than any university? There would seem to be a case for making a maximum effort to dissociate one's own pension funds from such investments before asking the University -- with its much broader institutional mission -- to take similar actions. When an argument is couched strongly in moral terms, there is a special obligation, I think, to consider the full range of implications -- personal as well as institutional --and not just to say ""enough"" when the lines become extremely difficult to draw or the implications too pervasive. The next group of considerations, 4, 5, 6 and 7, all have a common theme: whatever the effects of divestiture on racism in South Africa -- and to many they seem either negative or very uncertain or ambiguous at best -- the effects of divestiture on the long-term welfare of the University could be very damaging. It is natural, I suppose, that the Trustees take this set of considerations particularly seriously, It is their clear responsibility to do so. 4. Trustees are fiduciaries, which means that they have been entrusted by others, many no longer living, with seeing that the resources which have been given to Princeton to advance the educational and scholarly purposes of the University are employed as productively as possible for those specific purposes. Whatever a Trustee may feel personally about the propriety of investing in a particular company, when acting as Trustee for Princeton University there is an obligation to be scrupulous in not allowing personal convictions to constrain inappropriately the investment of funds that have been entrusted to the Univer-sity. That too is a moral obligation. To rule out, as potential investments, classes of securities in industries such as banking, or, still more generally, in large multinational companies, would almost certainly have a long-term financial effect that would limit the ability of the University to serve its most central purposes. Such actions would also make It difficult to convince prospective donors that the University was prepared to be a good fiduciary in the future. What additional constraints might be imposed next, would be an obvious query. 5. Another problem with divestiture that is particularly serious for Trustees -- and that is often not well understood -- involves the obligation to be fair and consistent in the application of University policy. An individual can say perfectly well, ""I feel very strongly about A, and 1 am going to act accordingly by selling my holdings in the stock of A,"" without being terribly concerned about fitting that act into some larger policy that has a demonstrable consistency. That approach 1s not possible for this University, however, at least not without harming its credibility. Thus, the Trustees have been resistant to the notion that we should ""make an example"" of Company A, unless we are really persuaded that Company A is so bad, judged overall and compared with all other companies, that it deserves such censure over the years, we have spent a great deal of time and energy trying to persuade others -- outside the University --who have disagreed with one aspect or another of life at Prince-ton, that they should judge the University overall, not on the basis of their attitudes toward, for example, coeducation, vigorous minority recruitment efforts, the alleged political views of faculty, or any other specific issues which may have troubled them. Surely we have an obligation to apply the same standard to those who displease us on one ground or another. This is why the Trustees have not thought that it was right in principle to sell the stock of a company solely because that company has not agreed with the University on a particular proxy question or some other policy issue. Every action that the University takes becomes a precedent, and therefore it is important for the Trustees to be sure that the precedent is one that they and their successors can -- and should -- follow faithfully in other situations. It is perfectly understandable that groups who feel intensely about a particular issue such as apartheid in South Africa may not be immediately concerned about whether the University treats all companies con-sistently, or whether it addresses another issue at some future time in the same way that it responded to a particular set of proposals for divestiture; but the Trustees have to take seriously precisely such questions of consistency if they are to discharge faithfully their responsibilities for the long-term governance of the University. 6. A sixth consideration for many Trustees concerns their attitude toward the use of economic pressure. Some who have advocated divestiture have been clear in saying that they want the University to use its ""clout"" in seeking to compel a particular company to comply with Princeton's sense of how it ought to conduct itself. Putting aside the question of how much ""clout"" the University really has, it has seemed to many of us that to use the economic resources of Princeton as a weapon in this way is to invite one of the things that we ourselves have worked hardest to discourage -- namely, the use of economic coercion by those outside the University to pressure us to conform to their ideas of (for instance) what we should teach, whom we should appoint to our faculty, and whom we should admit. Once we concede the legitimacy of economic pressure as a weapon in defining relationships between the University and corporations (or others), we will have opened a box that, I fear, we will very much wish were closed. 7. The seventh reason for concern with divestiture has to do with the political connotations of any decision to boycott the securities of a particular company or group of companies. Some of those advocating divestiture have been explicit in saying that it is precisely the ""announcement,"" ""embarrassment"" effect which they are seeking, an effect that they hope will mobilize others to follow suit, will energize lawmakers, and so on. I have been warned by faculty colleagues and others about exaggerating the power of the University in this arena, but the issue for the Trustees is not really the degree of the University's power in any case. The concern rather is with maintaining our independence -- and especially maintaining the openness of the University to a range of viewpoints on all matters -- which in turn depends on keeping a certain institutional distance from political debates that are not primarily about educational matters, including debates about U.S. policy toward South Africa. The purpose of Princeton as a university is not, ultimately, to determine the right constitutional policy for other countries, the right economic policy for this country, or any other broad public policies. It is, rather, to be an educational institution of the highest quality, that probes and studies such issues, that stimulates independent thinking on the part of students and faculty alike, and that takes pride in the contributions that its students, faculty, and alumni make, as individuals, in addressing such compelling problems as ignorance, inequality, racism, hunger, and the threat of war. But the University is in a much stronger position to be the home of outspoken critics and scholars expressing a variety of points of view -- as it must be in a free society -- if the University itself does not try to assume the role of political and social actor, attempting to promulgate ""official institutional"" Views outside the University or within it.* The university is unique among institutions in the degree to, which it depends on an environment of academic freedom or ""openness,"" Its pon-partisan, non-political character 15, there-fore, not just ""nice"" to preserve: it is absolutely essential. In this fundamental respect, universities differ sharply from political parties, churches, civic groups, businesses, founda-tions, and other organizational entities that may quite properly have political, doctrinal, or partisan goals. It is for this reason, among others, that Trustees who serve on the boards or in leadership capacities in these other organizations may feel much freer in those contexts to advocate divestiture or to take other actions intended to have political effects. This leads to another distinction: it is quite proper, in my view, for the University to speak out strongly in favor of core values such as an end to racism; it is quite another thing for the Univer-sity, as an institution, to advocate particular political strategies such as corporate withdrawal from South Africa. * From this standpoint as well as from others, voting proxies is very different from selling stock. Voting proxies can be seen as accepting responsibilities placed upon the University by dint of being a shareholder: it is a way of expressing views when one has standing to do so. Divestiture -- actively boycotting a particular security -- is a step that requires the University to initiate a political action, and that has seemed to the Trustees to press the University over a very important threshold. It is also true, of course, that proxies can be voted without constraining the portfolio, and thereby without raising the questions of fiduciary responsibility raised directly by divestiture.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdTID9apTKEye_7GM4jPdpkcVgVBEUA0qOCPuZa-mvc/edit?tab=t.wsli0hn7sjml,William Bowen,Male,1/30/72,4846,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Princeton,NJ,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",32,"I am pleased that the Council of the Princeton University Community is sponsoring this meeting, which has been called to give interested members of the University community an opportunity to hear directly the reasons for the University's current policies on investments in companies doing any part of their business in South Africa and to provide an opportunity for questions.

35,ptn5,6/4/80,Princeton University,Reunion Remarks,Remarks,Political CT,"Thank you so many members of the Class of It is a pleasure for me to be among and to have this opportunity to share a few thoughts with you. As we celebrate reunions again this year, I hope it will be with a sense of the essential continuities of Princeton -- continuities which have been reaffirmed by Reunions for more than a century now. Reunions bring back -- unite - - so many of us who share a loyalty to this University which overcomes, indeed overwhelms, all sort of other differences. Reunions afford opportunities for you to relax a bit, to relive your own experiences at Princeton, to renew friendships. May it always be so. But reunions also afford opportunities for you to renew your acquaintance with the University itself, to participate in the faculty-alumni forums, to talk informally with faculty and staff members, and with the students who are still here. I hope you will take full advantage of these opportunities, and I hope too that you will come back when the University is in session to see the Princeton of today for yourselves. There is no substitute for that. Indeed, I hasten to point out that Reunions can be somewhat misleading in the impressions they create. If my notes are at all accurate, I reminded your class five years ago of the determined effort Woodrow Wilson made to discourage reuning classes in his day from overindulgence in intoxicating spirits, his fear being that the resulting sight might ""breed a serious demoralization among the reckless and susceptible"" of the undergraduates. A quite different danger was pointed out to me recently by an alumnus, who wrote to me about his young son's reaction to Reunions in these terms: ""My son. .... had a great time,” but at the end of the P-rade, when Judge Medina asked him if he wanted to go to Princeton, he said; ""Does it have any classrooms?"" I trust that the Judge's response was in the affirmative. In the few minutes that we have together before the demands of my schedule require me to leave in order to visit another of the major reunion classes, I would like to say just a few words about the Princeton of today and the year that is drawing to a close. In many ways, it has been a truly extraordinary year. The year began typically enough with members of the freshman class succeeding in stealing the clapper. And there were the usual controversies concerning such things as the long lines in Commons and the banning of hot-plates and other heat-producing appliances from undergraduate rooms. In mid-October, we received word that for the third year in a row, a member of Faculty had been chosen to receive the Nobel Prize. This time it was Sir Arthur Lewis, the James Madison Professor of Political Economy, who shared the prize in economics for his pathbreaking work concerning the economics of developing countries. While this was a very well deserved honor for Professor Lewis, as the year went by, it proved to be only one of numerous awards received by many members of the faculty. We also continued to meet with considerable success in our efforts to attract outstanding faculty members from leading universities all over the world. This year alone, following the April meeting of the Trustees we were able to announce that we had persuaded distinguished faculty members to come to Princeton from such places as Columbia, Harvard, New York University, Cambridge University and Berkeley. The addition of these faculty members has been extremely important in and of itself, and it is also important for what it says about Princeton. As Clark Kerr, recently retired head of the Carne gie Council on Education, has said: perhaps the ultimate compliment to be paid an academic community is its ability to attract and hold outstanding faculty members. Also, in October, following a period of careful review and deliberation, the Trustees decided to endorse the ""objectives and general directions"" for improving undergraduate social and dining arrangements that had been recommended by the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL). Our time together this evening allows me to do no more than to note that since the time of this decision, we have received two magnificent gifts totalling eight million dollars for the establishment of the proposed system of underclass colleges. At the upperclass level, we have been engaged in a series of constructive conversations with representatives of the various clubs, and while it is impossible to know the final outcome of these discussions, I am encouraged by the tone of these discussions and by the evident desire on the part of all involved to find a set of working arrangements that will further strengthen the undergraduate residential character of Princeton. Throughout the fall and into January, the Priorities Committee struggled with the difficult questions of University finances. Their burdens were alleviated to some extent by a series of extraordinary gifts and bequests which were received by the University during this period: $2 million gift for the support of classical and modern Greek studies, the largest gift in the field ever received by an American university; $1.5 million bequest for the support of the library's book acquisition fund; a matching grant from the Mellon Foundation for the support of ""'intermediate"" faculty in the humanities; and a number of other important expressions of support for the University. Nevertheless, when the time came in January for the Trustees to adopt the 1980-81 budget, we were again faced with the need to make significant reductions in the budget base of the University while at the same time increasing tuition and other charges. Next year charges will total -- that is more than classes prior to paid for four years at Princeton. These trends concern me deeply and in my judgment there simply is not a more serious question facing Princeton today than finding the funds needed to pay for quality. In this context, I want to say a word of personal thanks to everyone here who has worked so hard, and contributed so generously to Annual Giving. Without that kind of commitment, and that kind of support, we simply wouldn't be the university that we are today. Throughout the year our students continued to give us reasons to be proud of them. As in the past, members of the senior class did exceptionally well in the competitions for the various national fellowships. And it is by no means only in academics that our students find outlets for an extraordinary range of talents and interests. The list of recognized student organizations, ranging from to continues to grow. Moreover, there are currently student agencies selling goods and services ranging from to In athletics, our men and women continue to do extraordinarily well in intercollegiate competition. Indeed, of the seventeen teams that competed for Ivy Championships this past fall and winter, eight won or tied for the championship and five finished in second place. As many of you will know, the football team, under the leadership of Frank Navarro, compiled its best record since 1970 and the men's hockey team coached by Jim Higgins finished with its best record since 1968. Helpful as they can be in conveying an overall impression, statistics concerning the variety of student activities fail utterly to convey any sense of the remarkable number of individuals attending Princeton today. While all of our undergraduates may not be as ""amazing"" as the seven who were profiled in the cover story of a recent issue of the Alumni Weekly, the past preponderance of our students exhibit a sense of humor about themselves, a concern for others, and a loyalty to the University that are tremendously reassuring. (story about Professor Mislow's organic chemistry lecture) As always, throughout the winter and spring, a number of difficult issues were discussed and debated on the campus. In February, after long and at times emotional debates, the Undergraduate Student Government adopted a series of reforms intended to reaffirm and strengthen the Honor System. In addition to such perennialete topiass as the University investment policies with respect to companies that do some fraction of their business in South Africa, questions were raised and rallies were held on such matters as registration and the draft, Iran, the hiring and promotion of women faculty and the status of women studies, and even whether a second student bagel agency should be permitted to operate on campus. If nothing else was accomplished, I do believe that the inane proposition that ""nothing is worth dying for"" was thoroughly demolished. Through the spring, we continued to benefit from a number of important gifts to Princeton including the five million dollar contribution to the support of teaching and research in the biological sciences received from the University of Riyadh. In April, Jim Wickenden and his colleagues in the Admission Office faced the difficult task of choosing among the nearly 11, 000 applicants for the 1, 100 places in the Class of 1984. This year proved to be the most competitive in Princeton's history and one indicator of just how difficult the admissions competition has become is that we ended up disappointing more than 60% of all the valedictorians who applied to Princeton this year. Also, this spring we have been engaged in a search to find a successor to Ernest Gordon who is retiring after twenty five years as Dean of the Chapel.

36,ptn6,3/3/82,Princeton University,Testimony before the House Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education,Testimony,Political CT,"My name is William G. Bowen and I am the President of Princeton University. I appreciate this opportunity to discuss some of the Administration's Fiscal 1983 budget recommendations in the area of higher education. As requested, I will speak directly to the potential impact on my own institution, but with reference to a range of broader concerns. As important as it is to appreciate the implications of these proposals for particular individuals and particular institutions, it is even more essential that they be understood in their cumulative and collective impact. I have tried to suggest a set of basic principles for thinking about the federal role in higher education in a paper recently distributed to members of this Subcommittee and appended to this testimony. That role, as I envision it, is a limited but extremely significant one, with special emphasis on four broad areas: (1) support of basic research; (2) support of graduate education; (3) encouragement of individual opportunity and diver- sity within the educational system; and (4) maintaining an envi- ronment that encourages private support of education and the decentralized exercise of responsibility for educational deci- sions. Given the jurisdiction of this Subcommittee, I propose to confine my remarks this afternoon to federal support at the graduate and undergraduate levels. At the same time I am sure you appreciate the importance to this country of sustaining -- indeed expanding -- our commitment to basic research. Excellence in graduate education is essential to teaching, to research, and to scholarship of the highest quality. Unless we find ways to encourage -- and ways to make it possible for --our very best candidates to pursue advanced training, we jeopardize the quality of our research effort and we fail to educate those who have the talent to become the leaders of the next generation in the sciences, in engineering, in international studies, and in all other fields. The preparation of a scholar or a teacher, or a highly trained practitioner in industry, the professions, or public affairs, is a time-consuming and expensive process, with benefits that never accrue solely to the person being educated. The United States today has an enviable reputation for the quality of its graduate education and research (as illustrated by the large number of foreign students who elect to come here for advanced training and by this country's remarkable success in winning Nobel prizes). But this reputation is both more recent and more fragile than many realize, having been built largely over the past forty years. A substantial federal investment has been critical in this process, and it is imperative that it be continued -- not for the purpose of educating large numbers of graduate students in those fields where job prospects are bleak, but to assure that the country will continue to educate its most outstanding individuals. It is also important to the nation that we make full use of the talents of all of our citizens, including women and members of minority groups. This is an essential objective at the graduate level because it is advanced training that qualifies individuals for academic positions and many other leadership roles. Federal support for graduate students takes the form of research project grants which make provision for graduate student assistance; fellowship and traineeship programs addressed to special needs; and access to the College Work Study, Guaranteed Student Loan, and Auxiliary Loan programs. The Administration's proposals would continue to support graduate work under research grants, particularly in the sciences. They also would preserve such critically important programs as NSF fellowships and NIH training grants, although without adjustment for inflation in the NSF program and with reductions at NIH. But in the area of international education, they would reduce funding by some 60 percent from Fiscal 1981 levels. They also would eliminate the Graduate and Professional Opportunities Program, which this year is supporting 17 percent of our black graduate students, and the public service fellowship program which supports students at our Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Providing programs of high quality in regional studies is extremely expensive, and the number of students pursuing advanced work in such programs will never be large. Nonetheless, it is essential to the country that those students with the necessary aptitudes and interests be able to enroll, and that first rate programs exist. This year, eight of Princeton's twelve U. S. Ph.D. students in Near Eastern Studies and four of our fourteen U. S. Ph.D. students in East Asian Studies hold National Resource Fellowships under Title VI. Without these fellowships, there is no question that opportunities would be foreclosed and the over- all scope and quality of our programs would be reduced. The Administration's proposal of greatest consequence at the graduate level calls for the removal of graduate students from the Guaranteed Student Loan program. This year, approximately 43 percent of all U.S. graduate students at Princeton are borrowing a total of $1.5 million under GSL. In the humanities, social sciences, and architecture, the figure is closer to 55 percent. The needs test imposed last fall is likely to reduce graduate student borrowing by about one-third -- in most cases not because the student is not in need, but because the needs assessment presumes a parental contribution that it is unrealistic to expect at the graduate level. In a recent survey, 56 percent of the graduate students with loans at Princeton said that they would not have been able to attend Princeton had they not been able to borrow. This figure was 77 percent for students in the humanities. While the ALAS program can be helpful to parents in states where it exists, ALAS can increase the cost of borrowing by as much as 67 percent over GSL, thereby making it too expensive for most potential graduate student borrowers. This is particularly serious for students already carrying substantial undergraduate debts or for those anticipating academic careers in the arts and sciences. Without GSL, many students will be unable to borrow at any interest rate, and thus will have no choice but to abandon their pursuit of a graduate degree. Recognizing the nation's overall budgetary constraints, many of us a year ago supported measures at the undergraduate level to restrict subsidized loans to students who could demonstrate need. We also accepted the phasing out of educational benefits under Social Security as long as needy students would have access to other programs. Unfortunately, the full range of student assistance programs has been cut substantially for this fiscal year (despite rapidly rising educational costs). And the effects of measures already enacted pale in comparison with the Adminis- tration's proposals for Fiscal 1983, which would dismantle major elements of a student aid structure carefully crafted on a bipar- tisan basis over several decades to enhance individual opportu- nity in this country and to undergird diversity within our educa- tional system. One of our most significant characteristics as a nation is our commitment to the proposition that individuals from all walks of life should be able to move up the ladder of accomplishment as far as their energies and abilities will take them. A key ele- . ment of this commitment is educational opportunity. By pursuing and expanding this commitment, we are able to take advantage of productive talents that otherwise would be lost to the nation. We also provide incentives for achievement, we encourage individuals to invest in themselves, and we give meaning to what is often referred to as ""the American Dream."" Beyond assuring access, the federal investment in educa- tional opportunity has enabled millions of lower and middle income citizens to exercise some choice in selecting those insti- tutions best suited to their particular talents and aspirations. One of the special strengths of our American system of higher education is the diversity of institutions available to students. Just as important is diversity of students within individual institutions. The federal programs now in place help to make it possible for individuals from different backgrounds, with different perspectives, to learn together and from each other. This would be important in any society, but it is especially important in a country like the United States which prides itself on its pluralism. There is surely strong national interest in avoiding the re-segregation of many educational institutions on the basis of economic status, race, or geography. The social fabric would be harmed greatly if this were to occur, and the quality of education would be diminished for all. The best estimates currently available to us at Princeton suggest that, if the Administration's proposals for Fiscal 1983 were adopted, federal support for student assistance under Pell, SEOG, NDSL, and College Work Study would decline on our campus from $2.8 million in Fiscal 1981 (i.e. the current academic year), to $1.2 million in Fiscal 1983 (academic year 1983-84) -- a reduction of 60 percent at a time when the need for such aid is expected to rise by about one-third. With 40 percent of our current undergraduate student body qualifying for aid, the loss per scholarship recipient would be $898 over a two-year period when tuition is projected to increase by some $2400 (from the current level of $7250): Looked at another way, this year federal grants under Pell and SEOG account for 17 percent of our total scholarship budget (roughly $1.5 million out of $8.9 million). Under the Administration's proposals, in two years federal support would meet just 3 percent of our total estimated scholarship needs. The proposed reductions in the Pell program would eliminate awards to between 300 and 400 of the 685 undergraduates who currently qualify for the program. For the most part, these are students from families with incomes between $15,000 and $25,000. Even those who remain eligible would receive roughly the same award two years from now that they would have received last year, when tuitions were 65 percent of what they are expected to be in 1983-84. About half of our undergraduates on financial aid (or approximately 950 students) currently receive average awards of almost $1,000 under SEOG, which is proposed for elimination. The average income of their families is $18,000. In addition, our students stand to lose some $350,000 in educational benefits under Social Security. They also face reductions in state scholarship programs if the State Student Incentive Grant program is eliminated. And they will incur increased indebtedness under GSL if, as proposed, the origination fee is doubled and interest rates are increased to market levels two years after graduation. I want to conclude by noting that whatever the actions taken at the federal level, colleges and universities are going to be hard pressed to sustain their traditional commitments to quality and opportunity. Traditional sources of income have failed to keep pace with rising costs, and even without cutbacks in Washington we would face increasing gaps between the resources available for student assistance and the level of student need. In developing our own budget at Princeton, which we have worked hard to balance, we have increased substantially the general funds that we allocate to student aid. We also require each student to contribute to his or her own education before scholarship dollars are awarded. Next year we will expect each freshman on aid to contribute $3,760 through summer job, term job, and student loans; sophomores, juniors, and seniors will be expected to contribute progressively more. We also are seeking to raise additional private support. Just two weeks ago we launched a Campaign to raise $275 million over five years, including $35 million for student aid. But even if we succeed in meeting as ambitious a goal as this, our resources for financial aid will still fall far short of expected needs. Institutions and students can and should be expected to do their share and to make sacrifices. But without a substantial federal effort as well, the goals that we have set for higher education in this country will not be achieved -- and it is our society that will be the loser, for many years to come.",,William Bowen,Male,1/30/72,3685,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Princeton,NJ,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",36,"My name is William G. Bowen and I am the President of Princeton University. I appreciate this opportunity to discuss some of the Administration's Fiscal 1983 budget recommendations in the area of higher education. As requested, I will speak directly to the potential impact on my own institution, but with reference to a range of broader concerns. As important as it is to appreciate the implications of these proposals for particular individuals and particular institutions, it is even more essential that they be understood in their cumulative and collective impact. I have tried to suggest a set of basic principles for thinking about the federal role in higher education in a paper recently distributed to members of this Subcommittee and appended to this testimony. That role, as I envision it, is a limited but extremely significant one, with special emphasis on four broad areas: (1) support of basic research; (2) support of graduate education; (3) encouragement of individual opportunity and diver- sity within the educational system; and (4) maintaining an envi- ronment that encourages private support of education and the decentralized exercise of responsibility for educational deci- sions. Given the jurisdiction of this Subcommittee, I propose to confine my remarks this afternoon to federal support at the graduate and undergraduate levels. At the same time I am sure you appreciate the importance to this country of sustaining -- indeed expanding -- our commitment to basic research. Excellence in graduate education is essential to teaching, to research, and to scholarship of the highest quality. Unless we find ways to encourage -- and ways to make it possible for --our very best candidates to pursue advanced training, we jeopardize the quality of our research effort and we fail to educate those who have the talent to become the leaders of the next generation in the sciences, in engineering, in international studies, and in all other fields. The preparation of a scholar or a teacher, or a highly trained practitioner in industry, the professions, or public affairs, is a time-consuming and expensive process, with benefits that never accrue solely to the person being educated. The United States today has an enviable reputation for the quality of its graduate education and research (as illustrated by the large number of foreign students who elect to come here for advanced training and by this country's remarkable success in winning Nobel prizes). But this reputation is both more recent and more fragile than many realize, having been built largely over the past forty years. A substantial federal investment has been critical in this process, and it is imperative that it be continued -- not for the purpose of educating large numbers of graduate students in those fields where job prospects are bleak, but to assure that the country will continue to educate its most outstanding individuals. It is also important to the nation that we make full use of the talents of all of our citizens, including women and members of minority groups. This is an essential objective at the graduate level because it is advanced training that qualifies individuals for academic positions and many other leadership roles. Federal support for graduate students takes the form of research project grants which make provision for graduate student assistance; fellowship and traineeship programs addressed to special needs; and access to the College Work Study, Guaranteed Student Loan, and Auxiliary Loan programs. The Administration's proposals would continue to support graduate work under research grants, particularly in the sciences. They also would preserve such critically important programs as NSF fellowships and NIH training grants, although without adjustment for inflation in the NSF program and with reductions at NIH. But in the area of international education, they would reduce funding by some 60 percent from Fiscal 1981 levels. They also would eliminate the Graduate and Professional Opportunities Program, which this year is supporting 17 percent of our black graduate students, and the public service fellowship program which supports students at our Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Providing programs of high quality in regional studies is extremely expensive, and the number of students pursuing advanced work in such programs will never be large. Nonetheless, it is essential to the country that those students with the necessary aptitudes and interests be able to enroll, and that first rate programs exist. This year, eight of Princeton's twelve U. S. Ph.D. students in Near Eastern Studies and four of our fourteen U. S. Ph.D. students in East Asian Studies hold National Resource Fellowships under Title VI. Without these fellowships, there is no question that opportunities would be foreclosed and the over- all scope and quality of our programs would be reduced. The Administration's proposal of greatest consequence at the graduate level calls for the removal of graduate students from the Guaranteed Student Loan program. This year, approximately 43 percent of all U.S. graduate students at Princeton are borrowing a total of $1.5 million under GSL. In the humanities, social sciences, and architecture, the figure is closer to 55 percent. The needs test imposed last fall is likely to reduce graduate student borrowing by about one-third -- in most cases not because the student is not in need, but because the needs assessment presumes a parental contribution that it is unrealistic to expect at the graduate level. In a recent survey, 56 percent of the graduate students with loans at Princeton said that they would not have been able to attend Princeton had they not been able to borrow. This figure was 77 percent for students in the humanities. While the ALAS program can be helpful to parents in states where it exists, ALAS can increase the cost of borrowing by as much as 67 percent over GSL, thereby making it too expensive for most potential graduate student borrowers. This is particularly serious for students already carrying substantial undergraduate debts or for those anticipating academic careers in the arts and sciences. Without GSL, many students will be unable to borrow at any interest rate, and thus will have no choice but to abandon their pursuit of a graduate degree. Recognizing the nation's overall budgetary constraints, many of us a year ago supported measures at the undergraduate level to restrict subsidized loans to students who could demonstrate need. We also accepted the phasing out of educational benefits under Social Security as long as needy students would have access to other programs.

37,dar1,12/1/84,Dartmouth University,The College Today,Press,Campus CT,"President: Clearly our communications with alumni have to be multifaceted: it has to come through the Alumni Magazine; the Bulletin; in the kind of personal encounters that alumni have with their college; and through the Alumni Council. There are a host of avenues available. Travelling around the country is not the most efficient way to communicate broadly with alumni, but it is absolutely essential if one wants to really get a sense of their concerns, a sense of their knowledge or lack of knowledge about the College, as well as the kind of contributions alumni are making within their own societies. And you can't do that unless you are face to face with alumni and in their backyard. So I have tried to go to alumni clubs that are not necessarily on the beaten path, but are in areas where our alumni are starting to gravitate in their professional lives. These areas are not necessarily in the traditional homeland of our alumni, the Northeast corridor, so I felt that it was important to extend our horizon and our travelling. As we look to the College's future, I think it is important to be in places such as Texas, Southern California, the Southwest, the Southeast, where Dartmouth is not a household name, to try to meet with alumni and with educational leaders to inject some presence of the College outside the Northeast. Insofar as the format is concerned, I think it is important particularly in areas not close to Hanover to try to do something about acquainting them with what's going on at the College today. We need to use audio-visuals more effectively because this is a visual campus, and we ought to somehow reinforce that not just with words, but with images. Probably the best format to use for me is to listen to their questions and their concerns, and to respond as best I can. Their views, observations, anxieties help make this process a genuine two way street, which is what it must be. Magazine: One of the -problems that Dartmouth, like all other colleges, is running intoinvolves financial aid. With tuition and othercosts going up every year, what is Dartmouth doing to ensure that the College willcontinue to have a diverse student body? President The key word is diversity, and it really means quite different things to different people. You can have a student body that is diverse on ethnic bases, economically, internationally, any number of ways. It means different things to different people. The campus today does have a healthy diversity, certainly compared to when I was a student here. The presence of women has been a great benefit to the quality of our educational system at Dartmouth. Beyond that change from the 60s and the 50s, there are more blacks on campus, more Native Americans, surely as a result of the initiatives that John Kemeny took, and there are also more international students. Perhaps more important is the College's healthy intellectual diversity. There are people who are oriented towards the arts, towards music, who are benefiting from the full scope of the liberal arts here. There are premeds, people who are more public service oriented, and they add an important dimension. There are people who are language oriented, or who are computer- oriented. All of them come to the campus bringing something they can teach others; and the adage of young minds teaching young minds is almost as important as young people learning from adults. We simply have to find a way to preserve that kind of intellectual diversity along with the social diversity so as not to give up the gains that we have made. With about two-thirds of our students on financial aid, the availability of financial aid is probably one of the biggest challenges Dartmouth has. Five years ago the federal government generated 25 percent of our financial aid budget; today that figure is down to 8 percent. That difference has been made up by the College through its own budgetary process. In fact, Dartmouth today still admits its classes on what we call ""need-blind""; that is, we do admit the classes on their academic and personal skills not on their economic situation and thus far we have been able to meet almost all of the needs of the students who have qualified for financial aid under the formulas that the Ivy League uses. But we have started to move, as have other Ivy League schools, towards capping the amount of financial aid we award. It is not unlimited. We are also starting to look at how to allocate financial aid based on merit. Every other Ivy League institution is starting that same process, so we are in a transitionary stage that is crucial in terms of financial aid. President: Too often, I think, we go to the alumni almost singularly for financial assistance. Yet it is absolutely essential that we do so, for without their support, Dartmouth would not be the institution that it is today. But beyond that, the alumni have a very vital role in being able to look back at their experiences at Dartmouth in terms of the lives they lead today, to help us understand how we can do a better job of preparing students. Part of the role of this college is to help young men and women so that they can find fulfillment throughout their lifetimes. To do that and to make sure that we are continually responding to the challenges and pressures society brings to our graduates, we need to have the advice and the counsel of our alumni and all they have seen and experienced themselves. We need to do that by listening to them, and also by bringing them back into the College in continuing education situations so that we can help them continue to grow. We need to involve our alumni in our governing system on our overseer boards, to involve them in the policy decision-making parts of the College, and obviously, to involve some of them directly as Trustees of this college because they are the ones who essentially make those fundamental decisions that will shape the nature of Dartmouth in the future. So, while the importance of alumni to Dartmouth is financial, it goes well beyond that. President: I guess in one word, survival [laughter follows]. I think we have made some crucial initiatives. At the top of that list is an investment in the residential systems of the College and a re- definition of the residential systems that reflects the changes that have occurred in college education in general and at Dartmouth in particular. When I say residential systems, I'm not talking strictly about the dormitories, I'm talking about that array of extra-curricular experiences that goes beyond the classroom. It has been an effort to restructure the College in a way that reinforces the academic purposes of Dartmouth by providing space and program funds for events in residential structures related to the purposes of Dartmouth. We're also trying to make the residential life system more attractive for faculty so they can reach outside of the class and work with students to help them develop as individuals in settings other than the classroom. Another area that we're examining is the adoption of a new calender for the College. It would increase the course credit requirements for graduation from 33 to 35 and require students to be on campus all three terms of their senior year and the summer following the sophomore year. This new arrangement would significantly reduce the number of attendance pattern options within the system. But it would help reduce fragmentation of relationships, and also provide the faculty with the opportunity to look at two common experiences, the sophomore summer and senior year. It gives them the opportunity to evaluate course offerings so that they can see whether the major needs to be strengthened, whether there should be more emphasis on honor work, and determine if there should be greater synthesis between departments or divisions. There are a number of other things that have gone on, many of them started by my predecessor, John G. Kemeny. The Rockefeller Center came to fruition in the last three years, but the planning was done long before that; the Hood Museum is moving along nicely and will be an exciting new asset. You can look at the bricks and mortar but that is probably the least effective way to measure an administration's genuine achievements. I think it is more the attitude, the the commitment of the institution to its goals, and whether people are working together supporting a common purpose. Any academic institution needs a healthy dialogue and a certain amount of contention on a campus, for it reflects the fact that people are not all agreeing, that they are challenging, pursuing truth in their own ways, and that is a very vital characteristic of a healthy institution. At the retreat, we attempted to stand back and look at the five or six priorities of the College, starting with the academic side. We discussed at some length the implications of the curricular change: How do we keep our faculty strong? How do we keep them well compensated, but also challenge them so that they can move their research ahead? We looked at the second priority hard residential life and what it means things that we have already discussed. A third area (that we also mentioned earlier today) was very important to us how to maintain the diversity we now have on this campus and how we could afford it within the financial aid constraints and capabilities of the College. The four area dealt more with the presence and the strength of our graduate and professional programs. With the Trustees' approval, we are moving forward with the expansion of the Thayer School of Engineering. As you know, we are now finishing the expansion of Tuck, and the Medical School is going through redefinition in the context of the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. This is both healthy and necessary to keep these schools premier within their fields. We also spent some time looking at what to do to sustain the vitality of our graduate program. At the present, we have ten Ph.D. programs at the College, almost all in the sciences except psychology, which is in the social sciences. We will be looking at whether we will add programs in molecular biology and computer science. Then we talked at length about the fifth priority, which is how to develop and reinforce the moral and spiritual values on this campus. Strengthening the Tucker Foundation will be a major component in that area. And lastly, we talked about the priority of our relationship with our communities, in the Upper Valley as well as the northeast quadrant of the country. It is absolutely crucial that we address each of these priorities to sustain Dartmouth as a premier liberal arts institution in the country. Our recent effort on computers is one leadership initiative that Dartmouth has taken. It should be ranked probably among those major accomplishments of the first three years. One of Dartmouth's strengths is that throughout its history, each experience, each resource, has been a cumulative experience, with the College always growing stronger. The College is better today than it was when I was here. I hope that I leave it better than it was when I came. I think probably the value of working within this kind of community, though I must say it took me sometime to appreciate this. The most satisfying, fulfilling experiences certainly relate to the undergraduates. They are the reason we are here. Tomorrow I will begin matriculating the Class of 1988 into the College. They are just as bright, fresh, and challenging as you could possibly imagine. You watch them and see that wonderful growth that goes on over four years. It's remarkable to see! It goes up and down, but the line is steadily upward. And then the sense of fulfillment that anybody here must have when, four years from now, you pass out the diplomas in June. The transformation is remarkable. If you can influence them at all, then it seems to me that is the fulfillment, the satisfaction that one gets. It's very real. She was valedictorian of her class, and she also won the Class of 1936 Award, which is the counterpart of the Bartlett Cup. She came from Texas, and while at Dartmouth she developed a sense of identity and assurance. She went through here academically in a way you would like to see all students go through the College. She took honors in mathematics and she just was a wellrounded student who was involved with her sorority and other student activities, serving on a number of College committees. She stands out because she was actively involved in a number of areas but still retained her sense of humility. The basic quality that Chrissie represented is not absent from most of the students here, and that is what makes it such a great place. I don't know whether discouraging is the word, perhaps frustrating. There have been frustrations in trying to deal with the kind of government system the College represents. I'm sure that the system has probably had its share of frustrations with me as well, so it's not one-sided. I think the other frustration is that issues seem to be so contentious for many on campus racism, the Indian symbol, gay student rights, ROTC. They are of concern to important constituencies and you have to address them. But we sometimes do so in ways that do not relate to the purposes of Dartmouth. If we can keep such discussions within the context of the role of the College in the future, then I believe we can have a more satisfactory dialogue. Well, I suspect that probably everybody comes with certain strengths, and the College's needs at any given time probably vary with the kind of environment that it's experiencing, and also in terms of the leadership it's had. I think my experience in management is helping Dartmouth address the economic pressures we face. I hope my background will also aid the process of allocating those resources to meet the College's priorities. You can't do this totally systematically as you might in a business because there is a lot of intuitiveness to the process. But if you can help the constituencies of the College come together, then it seems to me that that can be a positive contribution to moving the College forward. Out of the managerial experience I've had, I've dealt with a number of different kinds of people. Consensus-building is not foreign to somebody who comes out of the corporate world. I don't know if one discipline or one background is terribly crucial to providing leadership here. You would have to look over the background of my thirteen predecessors they all had different viewpoints, and the College survived and thrived under each of them. I hope I can make my contribution as well. For me, my undergraduate time was a terribly demanding time. I came to Dartmouth and was literally deposited on the corner of the Green, never having seen Dartmouth before. I was driven out here by somebody who was coming to the College; I almost had to hitchhike my way out. Coming to Dartmouth as a scholarship student, I approached my freshman year as probably the most peagreen freshman who ever existed in this college. So, the experiences I had were of a kind of amazement, Of enjoyment of what this institution offered, with a commitment to involvement. I was athletically inclined, but I was also in student government and a host of other things. The College at that time was much more isolated than it is today. There was a lack of diversion for orie's time then. This relative simplicity undoubtedly enabled us to concentrate more on a few things that we might do, and do well. Today, students have an incredible array of choice that simply wasn't there in the 50s. And that makes it tougher for stu- dents today to budget their time in a way that's efficient and satisfying from their standpoint. So perhaps we had it a little easier because we didn't have that choice to worry about. But the fundamental aspects of Dartmouth, its strengths and values, seem to me to be very consistent over the years. Well, I clearly remember ""Pudge"" Neidlinger '23, who was dean when I came, and Joe McDonald, who was dean when I left. I worked more closely with McDonald, so he was certainly a friend. The man who stood out for me was John Dickey. Probably the common experience that all of us from that era remember most was the Great Issues course. That was terrific. I will never forget listening to Thurgood Marshall arguing the merits of segregation and desegregation and what it meant in the country. It had a profound impact on one's thinking, which was only reinforced by the dialogue that followed all across the campus after those kinds of encounters. The whole place was galvanized around the issue. To me, that's the best of what the liberal arts is about. That's a difficult question because! think for many people that is almost symbolic of a broader experience from the past. Having a common academic experience at the College would be a very important thing to recapture. Over the years there has been more of an orientation in strength in the majors or strength in the departments, and it seems to me that that has occurred at a time when society and its institutions have tended somewhat more the other way. Issues today are becoming more complex, more encompassing of the whole host of disciplines that are brought to bear on problem solving. So, if the focus of Great Issues were a broadening experience that reinforced liberal arts and if it were integrated more fully at some point in a student's career, then I would be strongly in favor of it. But whether it took the precise form of Great Issues seems to be less important. At Dartmouth today, about 70 percent of our students go on to graduate school within four years of graduation. And they are going to some of the very best schools in the country. So, in no way do I think the liberal arts orientation of the College is disadvantaging students from future specialization quite the contrary. It would be very unfortunate (and undesirable) if Dartmouth were looked at as a preparatory school for graduate education. Because we are a liberal arts institution, our students should be able to leave this College, go into a number of different vocations, and find continued growth, happiness, and fulfillment within their lifetimes without necessarily going on to graduate school. The more we look at Dartmouth as preparatory for graduate work, the more emphasis there is on grades as opposed to learning. The more concerns of that nature we have, the less well we are doing in offering the kind of liberal arts education that is essential to the future. If people will look beyond the fact that a large percentage of our freshman class will be having computers and consider it as a learning device, an experience that will be important to them throughout their lives, then it will be a positive development. Initially, the faculty had to endorse this development by integrating the computer into the presentation of academic material. They had to step in and become part of that system in a very important way. To me, how the computer is used is the most important part, not the fact that it is there. What Dartmouth has done is to make a statement on the importance of computing within the lifetime of this generation of students. We have done it very effectively; I could not commend more highly the people who were responsible for that program, for bringing it about. In fact, we are probably two to three years ahead of most institutions. It's also important for the College to be able to offer adults computer training in the summer. In effect, we are saying to our alumni that they should not stop learning, that this technology is important to this generation as well as to their own. That is the role of this College to further liberal arts education at all levels, not just at the undergraduate level. So I think there are many different aspects of this development that are important to Dartmouth, not just because it is technologically oriented, but because it is liberal arts-oriented.

There are a host of avenues available. Travelling around the country is not the most efficient way to communicate broadly with alumni, but it is absolutely essential if one wants to really get a sense of their concerns, a sense of their knowledge or lack of knowledge about the College, as well as the kind of contributions alumni are making within their own societies. And you can't do that unless you are face to face with alumni and in their backyard. So I have tried to go to alumni clubs that are not necessarily on the beaten path, but are in areas where our alumni are starting to gravitate in their professional lives. These areas are not necessarily in the traditional homeland of our alumni, the Northeast corridor, so I felt that it was important to extend our horizon and our travelling. As we look to the College's future, I think it is important to be in places such as Texas, Southern California, the Southwest, the Southeast, where Dartmouth is not a household name, to try to meet with alumni and with educational leaders to inject some presence of the College outside the Northeast. Insofar as the format is concerned, I think it is important particularly in areas not close to Hanover to try to do something about acquainting them with what's going on at the College today. We need to use audio-visuals more effectively because this is a visual campus, and we ought to somehow reinforce that not just with words, but with images. Probably the best format to use for me is to listen to their questions and their concerns, and to respond as best I can. Their views, observations, anxieties help make this process a genuine two way street, which is what it must be. Magazine: One of the -problems that Dartmouth, like all other colleges, is running intoinvolves financial aid. With tuition and othercosts going up every year, what is Dartmouth doing to ensure that the College willcontinue to have a diverse student body? President The key word is diversity, and it really means quite different things to different people. You can have a student body that is diverse on ethnic bases, economically, internationally, any number of ways. It means different things to different people. The campus today does have a healthy diversity, certainly compared to when I was a student here. The presence of women has been a great benefit to the quality of our educational system at Dartmouth. Beyond that change from the 60s and the 50s, there are more blacks on campus, more Native Americans, surely as a result of the initiatives that John Kemeny took, and there are also more international students. Perhaps more important is the College's healthy intellectual diversity. There are people who are oriented towards the arts, towards music, who are benefiting from the full scope of the liberal arts here. There are premeds, people who are more public service oriented, and they add an important dimension. There are people who are language oriented, or who are computer- oriented. All of them come to the campus bringing something they can teach others; and the adage of young minds teaching young minds is almost as important as young people learning from adults. We simply have to find a way to preserve that kind of intellectual diversity along with the social diversity so as not to give up the gains that we have made. With about two-thirds of our students on financial aid, the availability of financial aid is probably one of the biggest challenges Dartmouth has. Five years ago the federal government generated 25 percent of our financial aid budget; today that figure is down to 8 percent. That difference has been made up by the College through its own budgetary process. In fact, Dartmouth today still admits its classes on what we call ""need-blind""; that is, we do admit the classes on their academic and personal skills not on their economic situation and thus far we have been able to meet almost all of the needs of the students who have qualified for financial aid under the formulas that the Ivy League uses. But we have started to move, as have other Ivy League schools, towards capping the amount of financial aid we award. It is not unlimited. We are also starting to look at how to allocate financial aid based on merit. Every other Ivy League institution is starting that same process, so we are in a transitionary stage that is crucial in terms of financial aid. President: Too often, I think, we go to the alumni almost singularly for financial assistance. Yet it is absolutely essential that we do so, for without their support, Dartmouth would not be the institution that it is today. But beyond that, the alumni have a very vital role in being able to look back at their experiences at Dartmouth in terms of the lives they lead today, to help us understand how we can do a better job of preparing students. Part of the role of this college is to help young men and women so that they can find fulfillment throughout their lifetimes. To do that and to make sure that we are continually responding to the challenges and pressures society brings to our graduates, we need to have the advice and the counsel of our alumni and all they have seen and experienced themselves. We need to do that by listening to them, and also by bringing them back into the College in continuing education situations so that we can help them continue to grow. We need to involve our alumni in our governing system on our overseer boards, to involve them in the policy decision-making parts of the College, and obviously, to involve some of them directly as Trustees of this college because they are the ones who essentially make those fundamental decisions that will shape the nature of Dartmouth in the future. So, while the importance of alumni to Dartmouth is financial, it goes well beyond that. President: I guess in one word, survival [laughter follows]. I think we have made some crucial initiatives. At the top of that list is an investment in the residential systems of the College and a re- definition of the residential systems that reflects the changes that have occurred in college education in general and at Dartmouth in particular. When I say residential systems, I'm not talking strictly about the dormitories, I'm talking about that array of extra-curricular experiences that goes beyond the classroom. It has been an effort to restructure the College in a way that reinforces the academic purposes of Dartmouth by providing space and program funds for events in residential structures related to the purposes of Dartmouth. We're also trying to make the residential life system more attractive for faculty so they can reach outside of the class and work with students to help them develop as individuals in settings other than the classroom. Another area that we're examining is the adoption of a new calender for the College. It would increase the course credit requirements for graduation from 33 to 35 and require students to be on campus all three terms of their senior year and the summer following the sophomore year. This new arrangement would significantly reduce the number of attendance pattern options within the system. But it would help reduce fragmentation of relationships, and also provide the faculty with the opportunity to look at two common experiences, the sophomore summer and senior year. It gives them the opportunity to evaluate course offerings so that they can see whether the major needs to be strengthened, whether there should be more emphasis on honor work, and determine if there should be greater synthesis between departments or divisions. There are a number of other things that have gone on, many of them started by my predecessor, John G. Kemeny. The Rockefeller Center came to fruition in the last three years, but the planning was done long before that; the Hood Museum is moving along nicely and will be an exciting new asset. You can look at the bricks and mortar but that is probably the least effective way to measure an administration's genuine achievements. I think it is more the attitude, the the commitment of the institution to its goals, and whether people are working together supporting a common purpose. Any academic institution needs a healthy dialogue and a certain amount of contention on a campus, for it reflects the fact that people are not all agreeing, that they are challenging, pursuing truth in their own ways, and that is a very vital characteristic of a healthy institution. At the retreat, we attempted to stand back and look at the five or six priorities of the College, starting with the academic side. We discussed at some length the implications of the curricular change: How do we keep our faculty strong? How do we keep them well compensated, but also challenge them so that they can move their research ahead? We looked at the second priority hard residential life and what it means things that we have already discussed. A third area (that we also mentioned earlier today) was very important to us how to maintain the diversity we now have on this campus and how we could afford it within the financial aid constraints and capabilities of the College. The four area dealt more with the presence and the strength of our graduate and professional programs. With the Trustees' approval, we are moving forward with the expansion of the Thayer School of Engineering. As you know, we are now finishing the expansion of Tuck, and the Medical School is going through redefinition in the context of the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. This is both healthy and necessary to keep these schools premier within their fields. We also spent some time looking at what to do to sustain the vitality of our graduate program. At the present, we have ten Ph.D. programs at the College, almost all in the sciences except psychology, which is in the social sciences. We will be looking at whether we will add programs in molecular biology and computer science. Then we talked at length about the fifth priority, which is how to develop and reinforce the moral and spiritual values on this campus. Strengthening the Tucker Foundation will be a major component in that area. And lastly, we talked about the priority of our relationship with our communities, in the Upper Valley as well as the northeast quadrant of the country. It is absolutely crucial that we address each of these priorities to sustain Dartmouth as a premier liberal arts institution in the country. Our recent effort on computers is one leadership initiative that Dartmouth has taken. It should be ranked probably among those major accomplishments of the first three years. One of Dartmouth's strengths is that throughout its history, each experience, each resource, has been a cumulative experience, with the College always growing stronger. The College is better today than it was when I was here. I hope that I leave it better than it was when I came. I think probably the value of working within this kind of community, though I must say it took me sometime to appreciate this. The most satisfying, fulfilling experiences certainly relate to the undergraduates. They are the reason we are here. Tomorrow I will begin matriculating the Class of 1988 into the College. They are just as bright, fresh, and challenging as you could possibly imagine. You watch them and see that wonderful growth that goes on over four years. It's remarkable to see! It goes up and down, but the line is steadily upward. And then the sense of fulfillment that anybody here must have when, four years from now, you pass out the diplomas in June. The transformation is remarkable. If you can influence them at all, then it seems to me that is the fulfillment, the satisfaction that one gets. It's very real. She was valedictorian of her class, and she also won the Class of 1936 Award, which is the counterpart of the Bartlett Cup. She came from Texas, and while at Dartmouth she developed a sense of identity and assurance. She went through here academically in a way you would like to see all students go through the College. She took honors in mathematics and she just was a wellrounded student who was involved with her sorority and other student activities, serving on a number of College committees. She stands out because she was actively involved in a number of areas but still retained her sense of humility. The basic quality that Chrissie represented is not absent from most of the students here, and that is what makes it such a great place. I don't know whether discouraging is the word, perhaps frustrating. There have been frustrations in trying to deal with the kind of government system the College represents. I'm sure that the system has probably had its share of frustrations with me as well, so it's not one-sided. I think the other frustration is that issues seem to be so contentious for many on campus racism, the Indian symbol, gay student rights, ROTC. They are of concern to important constituencies and you have to address them. But we sometimes do so in ways that do not relate to the purposes of Dartmouth. If we can keep such discussions within the context of the role of the College in the future, then I believe we can have a more satisfactory dialogue. Well, I suspect that probably everybody comes with certain strengths, and the College's needs at any given time probably vary with the kind of environment that it's experiencing, and also in terms of the leadership it's had. I think my experience in management is helping Dartmouth address the economic pressures we face. I hope my background will also aid the process of allocating those resources to meet the College's priorities. You can't do this totally systematically as you might in a business because there is a lot of intuitiveness to the process. But if you can help the constituencies of the College come together, then it seems to me that that can be a positive contribution to moving the College forward. Out of the managerial experience I've had, I've dealt with a number of different kinds of people. Consensus-building is not foreign to somebody who comes out of the corporate world. I don't know if one discipline or one background is terribly crucial to providing leadership here. You would have to look over the background of my thirteen predecessors they all had different viewpoints, and the College survived and thrived under each of them. I hope I can make my contribution as well. For me, my undergraduate time was a terribly demanding time. I came to Dartmouth and was literally deposited on the corner of the Green, never having seen Dartmouth before. I was driven out here by somebody who was coming to the College; I almost had to hitchhike my way out. Coming to Dartmouth as a scholarship student, I approached my freshman year as probably the most peagreen freshman who ever existed in this college. So, the experiences I had were of a kind of amazement, Of enjoyment of what this institution offered, with a commitment to involvement. I was athletically inclined, but I was also in student government and a host of other things. The College at that time was much more isolated than it is today. There was a lack of diversion for orie's time then. This relative simplicity undoubtedly enabled us to concentrate more on a few things that we might do, and do well. Today, students have an incredible array of choice that simply wasn't there in the 50s. And that makes it tougher for stu- dents today to budget their time in a way that's efficient and satisfying from their standpoint. So perhaps we had it a little easier because we didn't have that choice to worry about. But the fundamental aspects of Dartmouth, its strengths and values, seem to me to be very consistent over the years. Well, I clearly remember ""Pudge"" Neidlinger '23, who was dean when I came, and Joe McDonald, who was dean when I left. I worked more closely with McDonald, so he was certainly a friend. The man who stood out for me was John Dickey. Probably the common experience that all of us from that era remember most was the Great Issues course. That was terrific. I will never forget listening to Thurgood Marshall arguing the merits of segregation and desegregation and what it meant in the country. It had a profound impact on one's thinking, which was only reinforced by the dialogue that followed all across the campus after those kinds of encounters. The whole place was galvanized around the issue. To me, that's the best of what the liberal arts is about. That's a difficult question because! think for many people that is almost symbolic of a broader experience from the past. Having a common academic experience at the College would be a very important thing to recapture. Over the years there has been more of an orientation in strength in the majors or strength in the departments, and it seems to me that that has occurred at a time when society and its institutions have tended somewhat more the other way. Issues today are becoming more complex, more encompassing of the whole host of disciplines that are brought to bear on problem solving. So, if the focus of Great Issues were a broadening experience that reinforced liberal arts and if it were integrated more fully at some point in a student's career, then I would be strongly in favor of it. But whether it took the precise form of Great Issues seems to be less important. At Dartmouth today, about 70 percent of our students go on to graduate school within four years of graduation. And they are going to some of the very best schools in the country. So, in no way do I think the liberal arts orientation of the College is disadvantaging students from future specialization quite the contrary. It would be very unfortunate (and undesirable) if Dartmouth were looked at as a preparatory school for graduate education. Because we are a liberal arts institution, our students should be able to leave this College, go into a number of different vocations, and find continued growth, happiness, and fulfillment within their lifetimes without necessarily going on to graduate school. The more we look at Dartmouth as preparatory for graduate work, the more emphasis there is on grades as opposed to learning. The more concerns of that nature we have, the less well we are doing in offering the kind of liberal arts education that is essential to the future. If people will look beyond the fact that a large percentage of our freshman class will be having computers and consider it as a learning device, an experience that will be important to them throughout their lives, then it will be a positive development. Initially, the faculty had to endorse this development by integrating the computer into the presentation of academic material.

38,dar2,4/1/85,Dartmouth University,From the Desk of the President,Remarks,Political CT,"The question of the presence of Reserve Officers Training Corps programs on college and university campuses has been the subject of continuing, often vigorous, debate within many institutions. Divisions of attitude and opinion on this issue derive from philosophical, educational, political, and practical grounds. In varying degrees of intensity, such has been the case at Dartmouth over the past sixteen years. Before making a decision on what ultimately has taken the form of a proposal from the U.S. Army to establish at Dartmouth an ""extension center"" affiliated with the Norwich University AROTC program, it was essential to have an informed discussion within the College community and to address forthrightly concerns and points of objection raised by those opposed to, or having reservations about, such a course of action. It was necessary to establish, also, that benefits to be realized from reinstituting an ROTC program at the College would in fact outweigh potential disadvantages. And, importantly, it was essential to ascertain whether or not such a program would be consistent with the purposes of this institution. Obviously, this has been an issue involving very broad institutional interests, as has been evidenced by the considerable attention given the subject by the faculty, students, and alumni. The Dartmouth Trustees have been particularly grateful for the responsible and constructive approach that the faculty has taken in its deliberations regarding the educational-policy dimensions of the ROTquestion; and earlier reservations expressed by the faculty concerning the NROTC program have influenced directly the design of the final proposal from the Army. The financial advantages involved in the existence of ROTC accrue primarily to the student, and indirectly to the College. The student has the option to enter, if he or she elects, the military officer corps and, thereby, has the opportunity to enjoy significant benefits in terms of having his or her Dartmouth education financed by the U.S. government. In this context, it must be recognized that prese ntly over 60 percent of Dartmouth's student body is receiving financial aid a substantial portion of which is derived from federally-funded programs. If, during a time of rising costs, the federal government's provision is curtailed, as is presently being proposed, either the College or the student will need to make up the difference. Since the College cannot accomplish this without major programmatic and staffing reductions in other areas, the amount of student-provided self-help will necessarily have to increase significantly. There is the real prospect that within the foreseeable future Dartmouth may have to join Brown, Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Cornell of the Ivy Group in adopting the practice of ""admit-deny"" in the area of admissions and financial aid. In that event, a heavy burden would necessarily be imposed upon students, in terms of time devoted to on-campus, monetarily remunerative work and of debt obligations to be discharged after graduation. This problem is of sufficient magnitude that it could readily lead many well-qualified applicants to be discouraged from coming to Dartmouth in favor of their going to less-expensive, publicly-funded institutions, unless other outside sources of financial aid are available here. Clearly, ROTC is one such ""other"" possible source one having the potential of benefiting those students participating, by making a Dartmouth education more affordable, and of benefiting Dartmouth by drawing to the College talented young men and women who might otherwise be forced to enroll elsewhere. While the availability of ROTC scholarships alone would not provide the means to avoid the possibility of adopting ""admit-deny"" practices, it does have the potential to contribute to an avoidance of this possibility. Also, it is necessary to consider, in this connection, the question of the role of the College in our society. The College historically has been concerned with liberally educating men and women who could contribute positively to society, whatever their occupations might be. It should be noted that it has been possible for Dartmouth College to pursue and to accomplish this mission because ours is a free society an environment where freedom of thought and expression is valued and protected. That condition or environment exists, in large part, because this nation is sufficiently able to defend itself from challenge or dominance by those who do not share a respect for the rights of the individual. Having talented men and women engaged in the management and conduct of our defense establishment is surely as important as is having our best and brightest citizens centrally engaged in the forward progress and the destiny of other contributing professions in American life. The presence of Dartmouth-educated officers within the leadership structure of our armed services can contribute to and affect society in a positive manner, and, in so doing, it can further serve, constructively, that society which permits this institution to exist with the freedom to pursue its historic goals and purposes. Individuals will, in good faith, differ about the merits of having ROTC programs on campuses. While I respect the concerns expressed by the Faculty, it has become my own conviction that insofar as such a program provides the means for qualified students to attend Dartmouth without incurring prohibitive debt obligations, and insofar as such a program enhances the ability of this institution to serve society through its graduates, without compromising the central liberal-arts mission of the College, the existence of ROTC at Dartmouth has positive potential and should be accommodated. Following the faculty meeting on March 4, particularly because of the governance issues raised at that time, I have informed the Trustees of that faculty discussion, of the results of the faculty vote, and of subsequent expressions of concern addressed to the Dean of the Faculty. I previously had shared with the Board the materials that were available to the faculty, including the report of the Committee on Organization and Policy. After carefully considering this additional information, the Trustees have concurred that I should proceed to execute the ""extension center"" agreement offered to Dartmouth College. May I say, in closing, that I am indebted to all who participated so helpfully in our campus-wide consideration of ROTC during the past year. The plan adopted will reflect the value of that discussion, for it will be significantly different from and manifestly better than the proposal on which the faculty voted last spring. I recognize that there will remain honest differences of opinion on this issue, and I want to emphasize that it will be the Administration's intention to be sensitive to, and respectful of, those viewpoints as we move forward to implementing this program.",https://archive.dartmouthalumnimagazine.com/article/1985/4/1/from-the-desk-of-the-president,David McLaughlin,Male,6/28/81,1373,Republican,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Hanover,NH,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",38,"The question of the presence of Reserve Officers Training Corps programs on college and university campuses has been the subject of continuing, often vigorous, debate within many institutions.

I recognize that there will remain honest differences of opinion on this issue, and I want to emphasize that it will be the Administration's intention to be sensitive to, and respectful of, those viewpoints as we move forward to implementing this program.",1096,0.038767396,0.010934394,0.008946322,0.052683897,0.136182903,0.016898608,0.024850895,0.066600398,0.038767396,0.058648111,0.026838966,0.004970179,0.303180915,0.038767396,0.020874751,0.04473161,0.05666004,0.020874751,0.016898608,0.012922465,0.154075547,0.325049702,0.109343936,0.411530815,4/1/85,"Reagan

39,dar3,2/26/79,Dartmouth University,Faculty Meeting (pp 153),Remarks,Social CT,"Let me turn then immediately to the main item on the agenda at the initiative of this faculty, namely, your vote last fall to recommend to the Board of Trustees the abolition of the system of fraternities and sororities at Dartmouth College. The Board of Trustees considered that issue, having received in advance a very large mailing of a variety of materials. In addition to your vote and the amplification on that by the Executive Committee of the Faculty, there was also a recommendation from the Alumni Council, a report from the Fraternity Board of Overseers, and a document from the IFC, as well as many individual communications. Certainly the major portion of this Board meeting was devoted to that single issue. Hearings were held by COSA, by CEAF, and by CAPA to give opportunities to students, faculty, and alumni respectively to have an input. These led to a very lengthy discussion within the Board meeting itself. After that discussion the following action was taken unanimously by the Board of Trustees. The statement is rather long, but I think it is important for me to read it in its entirety. It is in seven parts: . The Board of Trustees shares the basic concerns that led the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to recommend abolition of Dartmouth fraternities and sororities. ❖ ❖ FACULTY MEETING . The Trustees commend the faculty for their concern and for initiating a productive debate that has stimulated the process of constructive self-evaluation by fraternities. . The Trustees commend the Interfraternity Council and its special action committee for their positive response to the faculty action, and for their recognition that their system needs to be reevaluated and reformed. . The Trustees call upon all members of fraternities and sororities to continue the process of bringing about significant and constructive change to better accommodate (I am sorry about the split infinitive, I didn’t catch it in time) the system to the overall student life at the College. . The Board of Trustees calls upon the Fraternity Board of Overseers to help to bring about the necessary changes and to help reduce the dominance by fraternities of the social life of the College. It requests the Overseers to furnish the Board with a progress report in six months and to file a full report on the status of fraternities within twelve months. The Board of Overseers is authorized and requested to prepare standards and procedures governing continued recognition or withdrawal of recognition of each fraternity by the College and to submit them to the Committee on Student Affairs in September . . The Board of Trustees requests the Executive Committee of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to make an independent evaluation of the fraternities within the next twelve months. Specifically the Board wishes to know whether the changes that have occurred and will occur during this period are sufficiently responsive to the concerns expressed by the faculty. . Should the Board of Trustees become convinced that significant changes are not occurring or that the rate of change is unacceptably slow, then the Board will be prepared to vote on the abolition of the system of fraternities and sororities. There is, in a sense, a companion vote to this one which arose ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING not out of the direct vote of the faculty but out of concerns that were expressed by a number of people, notably faculty members who testified before CEAF, that there was a need to study the fraternity problem in the broader context of student life on this campus. You may remember that the Board had begun to establish, last fall, a Committee on Student Residence with a fairly narrow charge. The Board has decided, in effect, that that was a mistake, and it is going to replace it by another committee with a broader charge. Here is the vote: “That the Board of Trustees deems it essential to the education of men and women with a high potential of making a significant impact on society, a civilizing quality of student life that is mutually supportive, enhancing, and fulfilling for all. That to promote the fullest achievement of that civilizing quality the Board of Trustees also authorizes a joint student/faculty/alumni and administration study of the quality of student life at the College, including social and residential alternatives, more creative use of dormitories and other buildings, and the development of plans for the utilization of facilities currently occupied by fraternities at such a time as they may become available. The President is requested to appoint a study group which is directed to report its findings and recommendations to the Board by March , , with such interim reports as it may deem useful and appropriate.” That puts it in a somewhat broader context and expresses the Board’s concern about the overall quality of student life. What I propose to do is finish my report to you and then give you an opportunity to ask me about any or all of the issues that I have mentioned. The third item we took up was a difficult item for me personally and for the Board of Trustees, although in other years it has been a rather routine itemthe voting of tuition, room, and board rates. It was a difficult decision this year because of the Carter Guidelines. Let me preface this by saying that once again we have had a year where I have had to request the Council on Budgets and Priorities to take a hard look at the preliminary budget and to ❖ ❖ FACULTY MEETING make some fairly significant cuts. That’s a topic for the April meeting, but it is in that context in which we are operating. I am sure that many of you have read the announcement in today’s paper of the increase in prices of Venezuelan oil. This is certainly not going to make their task any easier. We had some advance warning that this was coming, but it is apparently coming at a more rapid rate than we had anticipated. The Carter Guidelines fall into two categories. One has to do with compensation; the rules here are very precise and there are no exceptions. Let me comment on that one that our compensation policy will be to stay within the Carter Guidelines but to go to the maximum that the Carter Guidelines allow. Incidentally, since percent figures are floating around, the effect of this may be percent as far as faculty or administrative salary increases go, somewhat modified by what is called “breakage.” That’s an odd term; “turnover” is really what it amounts to. In the normal turnover in any employee group when somebody quits, let’s say, or retires after a number of years of service, and is replaced by somebody at the other end of the salary scale, the effect of that is to allow slightly higher increases overall and still achieve the same average. The impact on the College budget, however, is much more significant than that because of a most unfortunate development that will both hit the College as a whole and hit each of us as individuals. You know there have been, and will be, very significant increases in Social Security payments both in the half contributed by the College and the half we as employees have to contribute, and the big jump for faculty and administrative officers comes in the next year, when there is both a modest increase in the percentage and more importantly a very large increase in the base on which Social Security is paid. Now, the portion of it paid by the College is outside the Carter Guidelinesthe guidelines are very specific on thatand therefore the actual increase in compensation will be substantially higher than what I have indicated. That is, the cost to the College will be substantially higher. ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING Given all of those factors, the question was what to do with tuition, room, and board. Let me first speak to tuition, room, and board for Arts and Sciences students. The official guidelines are that prices cannot go up by more than the following: you take the average by which they went up in the past two years; you then subtract one-half percent from that average and that is the maximum by which it can go up. In answer to questions from other institutions the government made it very specific for colleges and universities that the governing figure is the total cost of tuition, room, and board for the typical full-time student. The average by which tuition, room, and board had gone up in the last two years at Dartmouth College was . percent, and therefore under the guidelines we would not be allowed to go up more than . percentlet’s call that . percent total in tuition, room, and board. That figure is more than our long-range guidelines called for. As I don’t have to tell you, the previous discussion on compensation will cost us more like percent or percent plus, and with declining endowment revenues one normally hopes that tuition, room, and board will help close the gap. You may remember that in November for planning purposes the Board instructed us that we should count on meeting the Carter Guidelines. The discussion became more complicated when we discovered that several of our sister institutions appeared to have gone up by figures that are above the Carter Guidelines. In the case of one school we believe it is within the Carter Guidelines, though it is much higher since they are being rewarded for the fact that they went up by very high percentages in the last two years, and of course that is a peculiarity of these guidelines. I don’t blame the school at all for taking advantage of it. But the other schools apparently, as best we can determine by inquiries, are taking advantage of a clause that was aimed at businesses and says that the business that is losing money may make corrections in its prices to the point where it breaks even. First of all, the whole question of “losing money” is a very complex one in academic institutions, ❖ ❖ FACULTY MEETING but I am happy to say that the discussion of the Board did not come down to this. I argued very strongly that we have been saying for a number of yearsand I certainly have said it over and over againthat the single greatest threat to private higher education today is run-away inflation. And I said to the Board, if the President of the United States recommends a program to hold down inflation and you only support it when it does not hurt you and fail to support it when it does hurt you, then we as an academic institution are setting the wrong moral example for the nation. I am happy to say that my recommendation was accepted by the Board of Trustees, and tuition, room, and board for Arts and Sciences will go up strictly according to the Carter Guidelines. Therefore, the only choice we have is where to put the increases, how to divide them amongst tuition, room, and board. The Council on Budgets and Priorities recommended that we go up with the amount we normally would have gone up as far as tuition goes, and go up a significantly lower figure as far as room and board are concerned, and still stay within the total guidelines. The Board accepted that, and therefore tuition will go up $ a term, room $ a term, and board $ a term, which, for example, will certainly mean that we will be losing money on food next year without question. Thayer School traditionally has the same tuition as Arts and Sciences. Tuck School has not yet had its Overseers meetings, so that has not been acted on. But traditionally they go up by roughly the same proportion as Arts and Sciences, and I will certainly make sure that they stay within the Carter Guidelines. The one area of the College that cannot live within the Carter Guidelines of costs is the Medical School tuition. And here one has the great irony that even after the Carter Guidelines were announced the Secretary of HEW has repeatedly told deans of medical schools that the only survival for them is to start charging the full cost of the education of a medical student, or at least a much more significant portion of it. The statement is made that if medical ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING schools are willing to do that the federal government will come to the help of students in two ways, one by providing certain service opportunities in exchange for which the total cost will be paid by the federal governmentthe Public Health Service Program is a good example of this, where you can get four years of medical school paid in exchange for four years’ work in the Public Health Serviceor by long-range loan plans which have not yet been worked out. In view of all this and the financial situation of the Medical School, that is the one area where it is impossible to stay within the guidelines. Thus the increase, for incoming students in particular, will be a very, very substantial increase. Of course, incoming students have not yet decided to come to this particular institution, and they may take the size of tuition into account in deciding to come or not. I believe almost every major medical school in the country finds itself in the same position. I have saved two happy items for the final news. I have waited since to see student government return to the campus. The Committee on Student Affairs of the Board received a report from a group of young men and women who have worked very hard over the past two years to return student government to the Dartmouth campus. They have drawn up a constitution which they have refined after feedback and managed to get the signatures of a clear majority of the students on this campus to approve not only student government in principle, which is easy, but to approve the specific constitution that is proposed here, which, as you know, is very hard. In view of that the Board of Trustees was delighted to vote approval of the new student government and give them a full go-ahead. I understand elections will occur this spring, and the government should be fully functioning by next fall. This government has asked that as one of its roles it should be the agency to name student representatives to various decisionmaking bodies. Most of these bodies are in the hands of the faculties involved. I understand the COP has at least tentatively agreed to let the student government nominate candidates for these posi- ❖ ❖ FACULTY MEETING tionsis my understanding correct? Yes. The Steering Committee of the General Faculty, which has its next meeting this week, has a similar request facing it. The Board of Trustees was asked about the one committee of the Board with student representatives, namely COSA, and the Board agreed that as soon as student government exists the new government will be allowed to pick the student representatives on the Board’s Committee on Student Affairs. Again, let me say how delighted I am to see student government return to this campus. My final item concerns significant progress in one of the major facilities items of the Campaign for Dartmouth. As you may recall, the largest single item and the largest combination of two items in the Campaign for Dartmouth is in the area of the arts, for reasons known to all of you that Hopkins Center suffers from too much success to the point where it is bursting at the seams. There are two specific components of this in the Campaign: the larger one is to help out the fine arts in a combination art museum, gallery, and teaching facility for the fine arts and the visual arts which has been in the Campaign at a tentative budget of $ million, half for building and half for endowing the maintenance and operating costs. The other is a $. million item for expansion of space for drama and dance. The two have been studied jointly by a committee, and their first preliminary report, including the report of the consulting architect, Mr. Chan of the Class of , was given to CEAF at this Board meeting. On the basis of this the Trustees have given a go-ahead for a full-scale planning effort for these facilities with the understanding that while final plans have to be approved by the Board of Trustees, this is, in effect, a goahead for the serious planning, the hiring of an architect, and eventual construction of these facilities as soon as a plan can be found that is acceptable to the Board and is reasonably within the budget guidelines laid down for the Campaign. I am pleased to announce major financial progress on this projectwe now have in hand between $. and $ million to- ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING wards the Fine Arts Center. I am quite certain that as soon as acceptable architectural plans are available we will go into the construction stage. We still have to raise at least $. million, possibly $ million, to be able to have it fully funded, but at this stage we really are in as good shape as we have been with any building project I can remember. The reason for this is that one of the most loyal and distinguished alumni of the College, in a wish expressed posthumously, earmarked contributions he has made to the Campaign for Dartmouth and a number of previous gifts to be applied to the building of a major new facility after his death, if the sums were sufficiently high. This is clearly the only new building we are planning in the near future that is major and is purely academic, and therefore the Board has earmarked it for that with the concurrence of the family of the late donor. The donor also specified that the building could be named for anyone that the College wished to honor. This is a donor who has been notable for insisting that his gifts be kept anonymous, to the point where I, as President, had no idea of the magnitude of his total gifts until after he died. There was no hint anywhere in the document he left behind that he ever considered having it named for him, but in view of the fact that he is a donor who should be honored by this institution even if he had never given a penny to the College, it was one of the easiest and happiest decisions for the Trustees to make the decision that the new Art Center will be the Harvey P. Hood ’ Center for the Arts. A news release will be coming out shortly. If you are not familiar with Mr. Hood’s contributions in general and his very many contributions to Dartmouth College, including six years service as a Trustee of this institution, I strongly urge you to read that release. If I may add one personal word to this, Harvey Hood was one of the nicest human beings my wife and I have ever been privileged to know, and I can tell you that if I get the chance to participate in the dedication of that building, it will be an enormous pleasure. ❖",https://math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/history/kemeny-history/kemeny.lectures.pdf,John Kemeny,Male,3/1/70,3284,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Hanover,NH,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",39,"Let me turn then immediately to the main item on the agenda at the initiative of this faculty, namely, your vote last fall to recommend to the Board of Trustees the abolition of the system of fraternities and sororities at Dartmouth College.

40,dar4,1/19/76,Dartmouth University,Statement at Faculty Meeting (pp 109),Remarks,Social CT,"A you know, the significant item for the long-range welfare of the institution on the agenda of the Board of Trustees was the matter of the composition of the undergraduate student body. The Board devoted a major portion of its meeting to this particular topic. One of the first things that happened during that discussion was that a consensus was reached that while very thoughtful input came from various constituencies, there tended to be a trend of concentrating on mechanics rather than on the fundamental principles underlying the issue. Therefore the Board decided to devote as much of the meeting as possible to see whether a consensus could be found within the Board of Trustees on the question of principle. I am happy to report that the Board did succeed, and that such a statement was voted unanimously, with all fifteen Board members present voting in favor of that statement. I will in a moment read you that statement, after which I will be happy to answer questions; indeed I hope you will ask questions. Since this is a statement of considerable depth and very great significance, I strongly urge you to listen to it carefully and ask as many questions as you wish before you react to it, as the Board did, since they spent hours discussing the statement and the details of it. The statement which I am about to read consists of three parts: the preamble for historical reasons, the statement of principle, and the statement of how to proceed toward the implementation of that principle. The statement voted unanimously by the Board of Trustees reads as follows: Preamble: Dartmouth College has achieved a position of preeminence in the field of higher education through the cooperative ❖ ❖ FACULTY MEETING STATEMENT support of three major constituencies: its students; its faculty, staff, and other members of the Hanover community; and its alumni body. The Board of Trustees has considered information it has received from each of these three constituencies with respect to the future composition of the student body at the College. A majority of both the undergraduates and the faculty responding have indicated support for a change in admissions policy to admit, over a period of time, significantly more women applicants to Dartmouth. The Alumni Council has requested that no action be taken on this issue until the Council has had an opportunity to consider the matter further at its June meeting. Statement of Principle: The Board of Trustees reaffirms that the fundamental purpose of Dartmouth College is the education of men and women who have a high potential for making a significant positive impact on society. In order that the College maintain its position of leadership in higher education, it is essential to enroll the best qualified students to fulfill this purpose. The College cannot continue to meet this commitment in the future within the initial guidelines on coeducation enunciated by the Trustees in . Since the admissions policy of the College must be a means of achieving the fundamental purpose of the institution, a change in the admissions policy is necessary. Immediate Steps: Many members of the several constituencies have not as yet had an opportunity to participate in a discussion of the methods by which the fundamental purpose is to be achieved; therefore, during this year, Trustees and administrative officers will meet with the various members of the Dartmouth community to seek their advice and counsel. It is the hope of the Trustees that such consultation will lead to widespread support of the Board’s final decision on implementation. The Board has decided to make no change in applying the initial guidelines to the selection of the Class of . ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING Let me very quickly summarize the main points: the Board has settled for all future timesor such time as when future Boards may vote otherwisethe purpose of the College; the fact that the admissions policy serves only one purpose, namely to lead towards this fundamental goal of the College; and the fact that the present admissions policy does not achieve this purpose, and therefore has to be changed. The Board has decided to allow one more year of discussion on the best means of achieving that goal. It is hopefully clear that once the Board of Trustees speaks on the fundamental purpose of the institution that is no longer debatable. I will be very happy to entertain questions. Let me make an obvious remark, one that was discussed in the Board; for example, in the change in the number of women, the Board decided to take one more year. It is equally clear under that statement that there will be a change in the number of women. The Board stated very clearly that the present policy does not meet the fundamental purposes of the institution and therefore must be changed. It specifically talks about having to reject the guidelines which put the limitation on the number of women. It leaves open such questions as the size of the College. Speaking now just for myself, I will oppose a significant increase in the size of the College. But I cannot speak for the Board. That is a subject that the Board would be happy to hear more discussion on. It leaves open the speed at which change happens, it leaves open the much more fundamental question as to what is the best admissions policy to achieve that fundamental purpose. If I may speculate, it occurs to me that as the Board does that, it is quite conceivable to me that the new criteria might have an impact on the mix of men admitted to Dartmouth College as well as women. The Board is really talking about a very fundamental reconsideration of the way students are being admitted to Dartmouth College. Question: Concerning one-year delay. I would like to give you as honest an answer to that as I can, ❖ ❖ FACULTY MEETING STATEMENT which is best done by giving the unpopular answer. The answer to that is that the guideline for numbers will be in effect for one more year, and very frankly this was a response to the Alumni Council. In my opinion, it was in response to the Alumni Council’s request for a consideration of the matter six months further. I think that those of us whomyself includedwould have preferred an immediate change, decided it was much more important to get the unanimous vote of the Board voting a fundamental change for the long range than to argue as to whether there will be ten or twenty more women in one class. I hope the vote is unambiguous. It is certainly unambiguous in the minds of the Board of Trustees that there will be a change commencing with the Class of . I hope that you appreciate that I answered that completely frankly. Question: Is it true that under the present guidelines there will still be more women admitted for the Class of than were admitted for the Class of ? What is correct is that if you follow the same guidelines for the Class of that you had for the Class of , the total number of women on campus will increase. I should have pointed that out, and I am glad that you asked that. You may recall that the Class of was a transitional class; there were only about women in that class. So simply with the graduation of the Class of the replacement by the Class of will result in a non-negligible increase in the number of women. I haven’t done my arithmetic, and I should have, but there should be perhaps seventy more women matriculated altogether at Dartmouth College next year than there were this year. Some Trustees actually brought up that argument for the reasonableness of a one-year wait. You realize that by the vote one year has been eliminated. They pointed out that in a sense the first transition under the original guidelines really will not be complete until the Class of is admitted. ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING Question: Was there a discussion of what is meant by best qualified? There was considerable discussion in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on that point. Does that mean best qualified academically, or in a general sense, or . . . ? You are asking the key question, and I can answer it very easily in principle because the Board was very clear on this. How they implement this is going to be a difficult question. But the Board has in mind very simply the following: if the purpose of the institution isand it isto educate men and women who have a high potential for making a significant positive impact on society, then the students we should admit should be those students who on the basis of their qualifications have the highest potential for making a significant impact on society. Now, you can then ask how you could measure that. You are asking a very fundamental question, but the Board proposes precisely to wrestle with that issueas to how one can do that. If you would ask me, I would certainly say that academic credentials are one very important measure, but there are others. The Board is very specific that whatever rules we come out with should judge individuals on their potential for making a significant contribution to society. Question: I understand what you are saying, I think. Has the Board wrestled with the question of whether the potential for making a high positive impact on society is sex-independent? In other words, academic credentials are important considerations, but is sex? I think the simple factual answer to that is that the Board has not wrestled with that issue. That is, certainly, as I hope you noted, the Board stated the fundamental purpose of Dartmouth College in a sex-blind way. It is clear, therefore, that whatever admissions policy they will come up with, sex will not be one of the criteria in the long run. You have asked a much more difficult question: whether you somehow feel that in today’s society that potential is ❖ ❖ FACULTY MEETING STATEMENT higher in one sex than in the other; and that you will have to guess, I will have to guess myself. The Board has not wrestled with it. Question: Concerning the phrase “sex-blind.” The Board was very careful not to use the word “sex-blind.” Let me show you why. Even in the meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences I heard “equal access” and “sex-blind” used in what I counted as six different senses. The Board was very precise in its statement. For example, a very common statement on sex-blind would be that you take the proportion of women, let’s say, in the total applicant pool in sex-blind admissionit was sometimes used that way in debate, Professor Baruchthat therefore somehow the proportion in the entering class should be the same. Clearly the Board’s statement is not consistent with that. That would depend on the pool. If the women’s pool has relatively more individuals in it who have a potential for major impact on society, the proportions would be greater under the new policy. If it turns out to be a pool that has less in it proportionately, then it would be proportionately less. But the question of how many men and women apply, I mean the mere ratio, will be irrelevant to the policy. Question: I am wondering if from your remarks I can gather that the final decision on implementation rests on resolving the problem of the male/female issue, or does it rest on resolving the correct admissions policy for Dartmouth College? I think the Board really would like, by the selection of the Class of , at least to take a first major step in implementing the new philosophy on admission. It will clearly depend on the debate on the size of the College. That has an impact. And it will also rest on the debate of the rate of change. You may recall that all the major constituencies favored change to come gradually. This [the ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING Trustee statement] speaks to the long-range situation, and it still leaves open the argument as to the rate at which change should happen. Question: May I ask whether the Board discussed the possibility that the Alumni Council might not move from its rather rigid position? Yes, that possibility was mentioned at the Board of Trustees meeting. And as you see from the last part of the motion the Board felt it was reasonable to allow one more year. As a matter of fact, it voted a sufficiently drastic statement of its own, and I think it would like to wrestle with that for a year. On the other hand, the Board is quite unanimous on the fact that the calendar year would be the extent of the debate. We would hope that whatever the Board arrives atand that wording is very carefully chosen there will be widespread support for the Board’s final decision on implementation. The key wording: the debate is on implementation, not on the principle; and secondly, the Board will make the final decision, although we will all work very, very hard to get as much support for whatever that final implementation may be. But the debate is limited to . Question: You said that the Board wanted input from all three major constituencies. What further can the Faculty of Arts and Sciences do in this respect? I really don’t know. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has given a very clear signalperhaps clearest of the three constituencieson its wishes. I simply don’t want to tell the Faculty of Arts and Sciences it may very well wish to stand on its previous stand, which the Board certainly knows and understands clearly. If you wish, in the light of this vote, to give additional input, you of course are free to do so.",https://math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/history/kemeny-history/kemeny.lectures.pdf,John Kemeny,Male,3/1/70,2150,Republican,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Hanover,NH,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",40,"A you know, the significant item for the long-range welfare of the institution on the agenda of the Board of Trustees was the matter of the composition of the undergraduate student body.

42,dar6,4/9/81,Dartmouth University,Talk to Boston alumni association (pp 191),Remarks,Campus CT,"T is my last chance and I’m not going to give the usual speech. I’m here, in a way, to say “thank you” to all of you, because the alumni of Boston have played an enormous role in the history of the College. My presidency owes an enormous debt to a great many people present in this room. I’ll give you one very small example of that fact: I have had the privilege of serving under five chairmen of the Board of Trustees. Would you believe that no less than three of the five are members of this particular alumni association: Lloyd Brace, Bill Andres, and now Dick Hill! I thought I might do a little bit of reminiscing. A time of stepping down is a time to think back. As I think back over the entire span of my presidency, there is one fact that I find most remarkable. And it is that I have served for over eleven years, and in all that period there has not been one single controversy in the ❖ ❖ BOSTON ALUMNI ASSOCIATION Dartmouth family. [laughter] On the other hand, if Lloyd Brace had intended that the thirteenth President of Dartmouth should be one whose presidency would be totally uneventful for Dartmouth, he knew he was picking the wrong person. So let me try to hit some of the highlights of that period. I had been President only two months when certain events called Cambodia-Kent State happened. There was the eruption of campuses all over the nation. Some of the worst incidentstragic ones, that higher education took a long time to live down occurred on some of the most distinguished campuses. The responsible way in which Dartmouth responded to that particular challenge will always be a matter of enormous satisfaction and pride for me. It’s probably the only campus on which that week is remembered best for lemons. I know that those of you who were there and were a part of it will know what I’m referring to. I remember the fall of . A memorable college opening Convocation, when I gave the single most successful speech I ever gave, even though I almost didn’t get past the first five words. The first five words were: “Men and Women of Dartmouth,” and I was the first President of the College ever to address an entering freshman class in that way. I remember the winter of , which was cold in more than one way because it was the time when the oil crisis broke out, a crisis that would lead to a whole succession of financial problems for higher education and particularly private higher education. We have been battling that problem for eight years. It’s not that the problems are solvedI’m afraid Dave Mclaughlin will have his own share of financial problems in the years to come and more than his share. But at a time when institutions all over the nation, even some of our most distinguished sister institutions, had to make significant compromises in quality, we did what had to be done, but we never compromised the quality of Dartmouth. [applause] I remember June of . The Class of will always be very special to me, not only because there happened to be a ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING Kemeny in that particular class who is present this evening,* but because it was the first class in the history of Dartmouth that had entered as a coeducational class. It was a truly memorable Commencement, and in a way it had set a tone; I think it had washed out some of the bitterness of the late ’s that hung on for quite a while on a great many campuses. I have to tell you, as one for whom being invited to other college commencements is an occupational hazard, that there is no other institution whose commencements are as lovely, particularly the ones we have had since . I’m looking forward with great pleasure this June to be able to conduct my twelfth and final commencement for the Class of . I also remember the fall of , when the Board of Trustees took a tremendously courageous step. After taking all kinds of outside advice as to what Dartmouth could possibly raise under a capital fund drive and then realizing that the maximum we were told we could possibly raise was not enough for the needs of the College, the Trustees decided to go for the staggering figure of $,, that everyone told us was unachievable. Here we are not quite four years later, and on March we passed $,,, and we still have a year and a half to go and we are counting. [applause] Jean and I will never forget the spring, summer, and fall of , which can best be described by saying that a nuclear accident happened to the President of Dartmouth. You have heard me talk on that subject and a great deal has been written on it, so I will not belabor it, but it certainly was one of the unforgettable periods during these eleven years. With much less fanfare, was also the year when undergraduate government returned to Dartmouth, and I suspect that that will have much greater long-range benefits for the College than anything I might have done in connection with Three Mile Island. It had been an enormous frustration of mine that during the ❖ ❖ BOSTON ALUMNI ASSOCIATION *Jennifer Kemeny ’, the daughter of John and Jean. crazy years in the late ’s undergraduate government voted itself out of existence. The frustrating thing is that as much as a President would like to see undergraduates reorganize themselves in a responsible decision-making way, the one sure way of preventing it happening is for the President to take the initiative. On almost anything else, yes; but telling students “you must organize yourselves into your own decision-making body” just isn’t possible. I could encourage them, I could advise them, as did many of the Trustees, but it had to come as a student initiative. It did come, its first year perhaps a bit rocky, but the UGC is beginning to return to an important status on the Dartmouth campus, and I have great hopes for the future. Perhaps the fact that we are going to have a President of Dartmouth who personally played a major role in undergraduate government in his undergraduate days will serve as an inspiration to the students. In the spring of I wrote my magnum opus, the Ten-Year Report, which I know all of you have read word for word and therefore I will not try to summarize it. [laughter] In that document I tried to report on the major events, on the good and the bad that had happened and the problems that still faced the College, and I took the occasion of presenting that report to the faculty to announce that it was time for the Board of Trustees to start searching for my successor. In the meantime, of course, I did warn the faculty that although common wisdom has it that once you have announced your resignation you’re a lame duck, I was not going to be a lame duck for my last year as President. It has been an eventful year, highlighted by major curricular debates brought about by a committee that was known by everyone on campus as the Wright Committee. It was named after a distinguished member of the Dartmouth Faculty who was on leave this year and who, by a very strange coincidence, happens to be present in the room this evening. Jim Wright, through an enormous amount of work, did a great service to the College. Also, in this year some of the major building plans of the Campaign for ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING Dartmouth are coming to fruition. We hope, within the next year, to break ground on two important building components in the Campaign: the Nelson Rockefeller Center for the Social Sciences and the Harvey Hood Museum for the Arts. Together, they should have an enormous positive impact on the future of education at Dartmouth. As I think back over those eleven yearsand particularly with June coming closerI can’t help thinking of the , diplomas I will have signed during my Presidency. Some of you may have heard me tell about the worst moment I ever had. When I appear at the Commencement ceremony I can hardly move my right armwhich is all right because I certainly believe every Dartmouth student should get individually signed diplomasbut I have never forgotten the one wise guy who right after Commencement said, “Thanks a lot for putting a rubber stamp on my diploma.” The only thing worse than having just signed , diplomas individually is to have a student think that it was a rubber stamp. [laughter] Thirteen thousand diplomas are not pieces of paper. They represent thirteen thousand individual human beings, and by the conclusion of my twelfth commencement that will be one-third of the living alumni of Dartmouth College. I wish I could say that I have gotten to know all of them well, but of course that is no longer possible in an institution that has become as complex as Dartmouth. I did have about , of them as students in my own classes, however, during the eleven years, and I got to know many of them quite well, perhaps because they were student leaders or because they caused trouble or because they were editors of The Dartmouthwhich, of course, would put them into both categories[laughter] or simply because I never did stop having weekly office hours for students, and a great many students were nice enough to come in just to talk. As I look at the changes in the eleven years, perhaps the following few facts may be symbolic of them: We do have a woman as editor-in-chief of The Dartmouth, ❖ ❖ BOSTON ALUMNI ASSOCIATION and, incidentally, the current directorate of The Dartmouth is excellent. I shouldn’t admit that before I step down from the job because they’ll probably blast me on Monday! [laughter] At the head of the Undergraduate Council we have a very highly respected student who happens to be black. We have the first woman Rhodes Scholar in the history of Dartmouth College.* The statistic that tells a great story, to me personally, is the fact that during my administration and including this Commencement, Dartmouth will have graduated three times as many American Indians as in the first years of the history of the College. [applause] They have been good years. If Dave McLaughlin had asked me what the job is like which fortunately he didn’t, as there is some magic about being offered the presidency of Dartmouth that brings about temporary insanity in anyoneI would have had to tell him that it’s a job that requires absolutely incredible hours, it’s a job whose frustration is endless, it’s a job that one can never put out of one’s mind, it’s a job that gives you nightmares about money, usually the money you do not have. It’s also a job I would not have missed for anything in the world. But as one who has always believed in the importance of change, because institutions that do not change will stagnate, I happen to believe that the most important change for Dartmouth College today is a change in the presidency. I’m delighted with the choice the Board of Trustees has made, and eighty days from now we will inaugurate the fourteenth President of the College. I just happen to know the exact number of daysJean and I have been counting them for quite a while. [laughter] Both she and I are happy, we are relieved, and we are looking forward to the future. Since so many of you have been kind enough to ask what we are planning to do in the future, I’d like to close with a few remarks about that. ❖ ❖ JOHN KEMENY SPEAKING *Mary Cleary ’. First of all, starting June , I have a year’s sabbatical. It will be my first sabbatical in sixteen years, and I am looking forward to it enormously. Our plans are very specific. For the first month we plan to sleep. [laughter] Beyond that Jean has a second book planned. She has done all the research, but she has had no time at all to put a single word on paper, and she hopes to do some serious writing. I have a very specific challenge that I’ll use the other eleven months for. Going back to teaching will be very easy for me because I’ve never stopped teaching. But returning to research which any good faculty member at an institution as good as Dartmouth should dois a very different kind of challenge. No field stands still for eleven years, and I have a great deal of catching up to do, which means reading and thinking and making choices about fields of research. I have worked in some five different fields in my life, and I will have to choose which ones, if any, I can still catch up with and make a contribution to for the remainder of my career. When it came to a question of exactly what to do after the presidency the choice was very wide. I have been fortunate enough to have been offered a great many opportunities, and Jean has always stood by me and made it very clear, as she has throughout our marriage, that whatever I decided was all right with her, that she could support me in any career I chose. The only condition she placed on thatwhich was a very minor onewas that it had to be in Hanover, New Hampshire. [laughter] That made the choice obvious, and a year from this June I am returning to fulltime teaching at Dartmouth College. [applause] A year from June I’ll be back at my favorite job, and while I have a chance to put in a commercial let me do so. I hope you will send your grandchildren, your children, your brothers, sisters, and cousins to Dartmouth, as I look forward to having them in my classes. History alone will be able to judge whether my presidency was good or what my record is worth. But there is one thing I do know for certain, I’m one hell of a good teacher. [applause] ❖ ❖ BOSTON ALUMNI ASSOCIATION George Johnston: President Kemeny, as always, it has been a privilege to have you with us. In order to commemorate this, your last official appearance in Boston as President of Dartmouth College, and to assure us of your continuing relationship with this association of Dartmouth Alumni, my Board has authorized me to make you an Honorary Lifetime Member. To acknowledge this fact, one of your students, Scott Axford, Class of ’, has prepared a document which reads, “The Dartmouth Alumni Association of Eastern Massachusetts, the largest Association of Dartmouth Alumni in the world, is pleased to confer an Honorary Lifetime Membership upon John G. Kemeny ’ Ad. on the occasion of his last public appearance for the Association as President of Dartmouth College, on this the ninth day of April, .” Thank you very much. President Kemeny: I’m deeply moved, but I do remember that earlier in the meeting the chairman pointed out that you are terribly short of membership dues in the Alumni Association. Seriously, it is a wonderful tribute, and both Jean and I will be very pleased for the rest of our lives to think of ourselves as honorary members of the greatest Dartmouth Club in the country",https://math.dartmouth.edu/news-resources/history/kemeny-history/kemeny.lectures.pdf,John Kemeny,Male,3/1/70,4057,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Hanover,NH,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",42,"T is my last chance and I’m not going to give the usual speech. I’m here, in a way, to say “thank you” to all of you, because the alumni of Boston have played an enormous role in the history of the College. My presidency owes an enormous debt to a great many people present in this room. I’ll give you one very small example of that fact: I have had the privilege of serving under five chairmen of the Board of Trustees. Would you believe that no less than three of the five are members of this particular alumni association: Lloyd Brace, Bill Andres, and now Dick Hill! I thought I might do a little bit of reminiscing. A time of stepping down is a time to think back. As I think back over the entire span of my presidency, there is one fact that I find most remarkable. And it is that I have served for over eleven years, and in all that period there has not been one single controversy in the ❖ ❖ BOSTON ALUMNI ASSOCIATION Dartmouth family. [laughter] On the other hand, if Lloyd Brace had intended that the thirteenth President of Dartmouth should be one whose presidency would be totally uneventful for Dartmouth, he knew he was picking the wrong person. So let me try to hit some of the highlights of that period. I had been President only two months when certain events called Cambodia-Kent State happened. There was the eruption of campuses all over the nation. Some of the worst incidentstragic ones, that higher education took a long time to live down occurred on some of the most distinguished campuses. The responsible way in which Dartmouth responded to that particular challenge will always be a matter of enormous satisfaction and pride for me. It’s probably the only campus on which that week is remembered best for lemons. I know that those of you who were there and were a part of it will know what I’m referring to. I remember the fall of . A memorable college opening Convocation, when I gave the single most successful speech I ever gave, even though I almost didn’t get past the first five words. The first five words were: “Men and Women of Dartmouth,” and I was the first President of the College ever to address an entering freshman class in that way. I remember the winter of , which was cold in more than one way because it was the time when the oil crisis broke out, a crisis that would lead to a whole succession of financial problems for higher education and particularly private higher education.

43,chi1,5/7/82,University of Chicago,"Statement of Hanna H. Gray, President, University of Chicago, House Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of Interior and Related Agencies",Testimony,Political CT,"Mr. Chairman, members of the Subcommittee: I am grateful for this opportunity to testify before you this morning. I am by training and profession a historian of Europe in the age of the Renaissance and Reformation and a teacher of history and the humanities. I have served on the National Council on the Humanities and last summer served as a co-chairman of the Presidential Task Force on the Arts and Humanities. That group engaged in a broad and intensive review of the condition of the arts and humanities in this country, of the structures for their support, and of the role of a federal presence in these areas. In public meetings, in smaller discussion groups, and in individual communications from many concerned citizens, we became increasingly aware of the scope and depth (which extend far beyond the academic world) of the support enjoyed by the two Endowments. At the end of its inquiry, this task force of 36 people of widely divergent backgrounds and political persuasions came to a unanimous conclusion. We said in our report to the President that the encouragement of the arts and humanities represents a proper and important function of the federal government. We recommended that the basic structures and procedures of the Endowments be maintained as the effective and appropriate means for channeling such support. Our strong reaffirmation of the significant role played by these relatively small agencies arises from the conviction that the quality and creativity of our culture, which are intrinsically valuable, have to do also and in important ways with the larger social good, with key long-term objectives of our national purpose. Democracy requires independent, thoughtful, well- informed citizens for its healthy functioning. Our society has never been in greater need of educated competence, critical judgment, the capacity to understand our own and other cultures, the power to see and to cope with the complex questions and the intricate relationships of human life in its varied and changing dimensions, the conquest of insularity and narrowness of vision, a sensitivity to the central issues of human and humane existence in the context of our experience and of our best thinking about the present and future. The NEH exists to enable learning and discovery in the disciplines of the humanities, to expand and enrich public awareness and participation in the fruits of these activities. Its existence has made possible what could otherwise not be accomplished, or accomplished by other means alone. Its grants to institutions, groups and individuals have represented only a small proportion of the support for the humanities--but that contribution has made a critical difference and has helped in fact to stimulate private support as well. I believe that the sustenance of creative scholarship and first-rate education in the humanities must be a high priority of national policy. It has not been costly. The short-sighted policies which propose radically reduced funding for these purposes would, if accepted, exact a heavy cost later. Given my own experience in the academic world, I should like to explain why this is so by speaking to the NEH's impact on the quality of education in this country, and especially on the activities that are carried on in research universities. The humanities by their very nature are less visible than the arts and may not command the same dramatic attention. Similarly, their support is in a sense more diffuse, deriving less from individual acts of private philanthropy than from the institutional resources, which have to be allocated to many different areas, that have been built up through such philanthropy. Thus universities, for example, may house and support many of the great collections essential for scholars everywhere and not only for their own students and faculties. The economy of research and advanced training in the humanities is and will remain essentially that of the universities themselves, helped by foundations and donors, and in collaboration with museums, learned societies, and independent libraries. But these economies are strained and subject to pressing demands elsewhere, and they cannot alone supply the seed money required for major new projects, for larger programs of fellowships for individual research and training, for long-range enterprises of research--all of which contribute to the development of learning and the resources life beyond the confines of of learning that have any single institution. The work of the nation's research institutions falls broadly into the integrally related activities of teaching and research. The continual renewal of the academic fields through scholarship has a direct effect on the substance and quality of teaching. Creative teaching and understanding depend on the continuous expansion and reexamination of knowledge. A few examples will illustrate more concretely the extent of the NEH's contribution to humanistic research. I begin with a project sponsored by Claremont College in California. Since 1979, Claremont has coordinated the production of an Encyclopedia of the American Constitution, a work that will ultimately cover every dimension of American constitutional history and law. The Encyclopedia is fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of 215 distinguished scholars from three disciplines--history, political science, and law. Publication is scheduled for 1987, the bicentennial of the Constitutional Convention. Funding for the project comes from a variety of sources including support from the foundation and publishing worlds, a contribution from Claremont College, and a grant from the NEH. The broad private and institutional support which the Encyclopedia has succeeded in attracting illustrates the important catalytic role that the NEH plays in stimulating private investment in the nation's scholarly resources. This encyclopedia exemplifies the fundamental strength of the NEH. No single university's resources would have been sufficient to undertake the project. NE seed money made it possible for scholars across the nation to collaborate on a project that will vastly enrich our understanding of our nation's legal and philosophical foundations. Let me offer another instance of the NEH's contributions to the nation's cultural life. For many years the works of the greatest American authors have been buried in obscure, frequently out of print editions. Now, thanks to the leadership of Harvard's Professor Daniel Aaron and with funding from the Ford Foundation and from the NEH, our literary tradition will be accessible in an inexpensive, authoritative edition. Students, teachers, scholars, and the general public will be the beneficiaries of a project which fills a gaping hole and therefore greatly strengthens the accessibility of our national literary heritage. I cannot resist a brief reference to the Assyrian Dictionary, one of a number of important lexicographical projects on which members of our faculty at the University of Chicago are working. The Dictionary was begun in 1921. The first volume appeared in 1956, and subsequent volumes have been published steadily since then. In 1976 the Dictionary received its first grant from the NEH, and it is my understanding that the pace of work and hence also the Dictionary's availability have increased to such a point that the conclusion of the project is optimistically predicted sometime during the next decade rather than in the next century. When complete, the dictionary will provide a bridge to an hitherto little understood civilization which exerted enormous influence on near eastern history. We will be in a position to understand a great deal more about an entire civilization, indeed to help preserve it, and so to understand more about ourselves and our world at the same time. No survey, no matter how brief, of NEH's contributions to the humanities would be complete without some reference to NEH's role in strengthening the most important tool of humanistic research--the nation's libraries. The treasures of our libraries must be preserved if humanistic research is to continue in the future. The NEH has provided enormous help to libraries and archives working to conserve, preserve, and catalogue their collections. In light of these accomplishments and the widespread support that the Endowments enjoy, it is certainly unfortunate that reduced federal support for the NEH is again being proposed. Support for the NEH dropped by 14% last year--from $151.3 million in FY 1981 to $130.6 million in FY 1982. Only the exceptional leadership of this Subcommittee in the appropriations process prevented even sharper cuts in the FY 1982 funding level. We in the academic community are exceedingly grateful for this assistance. We call on your leadership once more. The Administration has proposed further drastic cuts-- amounting to more than 25%--for the NEH in FY 1983. I believe it essential that these cuts be resisted. Since their creation in 1965, the Endowments for the Arts and Humanities have received strong bipartisan support. Both Democratic and Republican Presidents have recognized the enormous public benefits derived from the relatively small sums spent on the Endowments. We cannot afford a weakening of this commitment. I am not asking the government to assume the dominant role in the support of scholarship in the humanities. But creative government support clearly can play a vital tole in stimulating and disseminating humanistic research. It can set an example by encouraging the kinds of projects that will expand and diversity our cultural resources. It can provide seed money and thereby attract private donors to projects.

I am by training and profession a historian of Europe in the age of the Renaissance and Reformation and a teacher of history and the humanities. I have served on the National Council on the Humanities and last summer served as a co-chairman of the Presidential Task Force on the Arts and Humanities. That group engaged in a broad and intensive review of the condition of the arts and humanities in this country, of the structures for their support, and of the role of a federal presence in these areas. In public meetings, in smaller discussion groups, and in individual communications from many concerned citizens, we became increasingly aware of the scope and depth (which extend far beyond the academic world) of the support enjoyed by the two Endowments. At the end of its inquiry, this task force of 36 people of widely divergent backgrounds and political persuasions came to a unanimous conclusion. We said in our report to the President that the encouragement of the arts and humanities represents a proper and important function of the federal government. We recommended that the basic structures and procedures of the Endowments be maintained as the effective and appropriate means for channeling such support. Our strong reaffirmation of the significant role played by these relatively small agencies arises from the conviction that the quality and creativity of our culture, which are intrinsically valuable, have to do also and in important ways with the larger social good, with key long-term objectives of our national purpose. Democracy requires independent, thoughtful, well- informed citizens for its healthy functioning. Our society has never been in greater need of educated competence, critical judgment, the capacity to understand our own and other cultures, the power to see and to cope with the complex questions and the intricate relationships of human life in its varied and changing dimensions, the conquest of insularity and narrowness of vision, a sensitivity to the central issues of human and humane existence in the context of our experience and of our best thinking about the present and future. The NEH exists to enable learning and discovery in the disciplines of the humanities, to expand and enrich public awareness and participation in the fruits of these activities. Its existence has made possible what could otherwise not be accomplished, or accomplished by other means alone. Its grants to institutions, groups and individuals have represented only a small proportion of the support for the humanities--but that contribution has made a critical difference and has helped in fact to stimulate private support as well. I believe that the sustenance of creative scholarship and first-rate education in the humanities must be a high priority of national policy. It has not been costly. The short-sighted policies which propose radically reduced funding for these purposes would, if accepted, exact a heavy cost later. Given my own experience in the academic world, I should like to explain why this is so by speaking to the NEH's impact on the quality of education in this country, and especially on the activities that are carried on in research universities. The humanities by their very nature are less visible than the arts and may not command the same dramatic attention. Similarly, their support is in a sense more diffuse, deriving less from individual acts of private philanthropy than from the institutional resources, which have to be allocated to many different areas, that have been built up through such philanthropy. Thus universities, for example, may house and support many of the great collections essential for scholars everywhere and not only for their own students and faculties. The economy of research and advanced training in the humanities is and will remain essentially that of the universities themselves, helped by foundations and donors, and in collaboration with museums, learned societies, and independent libraries. But these economies are strained and subject to pressing demands elsewhere, and they cannot alone supply the seed money required for major new projects, for larger programs of fellowships for individual research and training, for long-range enterprises of research--all of which contribute to the development of learning and the resources life beyond the confines of of learning that have any single institution. The work of the nation's research institutions falls broadly into the integrally related activities of teaching and research. The continual renewal of the academic fields through scholarship has a direct effect on the substance and quality of teaching. Creative teaching and understanding depend on the continuous expansion and reexamination of knowledge. A few examples will illustrate more concretely the extent of the NEH's contribution to humanistic research. I begin with a project sponsored by Claremont College in California. Since 1979, Claremont has coordinated the production of an Encyclopedia of the American Constitution, a work that will ultimately cover every dimension of American constitutional history and law. The Encyclopedia is fortunate to be able to draw on the expertise of 215 distinguished scholars from three disciplines--history, political science, and law. Publication is scheduled for 1987, the bicentennial of the Constitutional Convention. Funding for the project comes from a variety of sources including support from the foundation and publishing worlds, a contribution from Claremont College, and a grant from the NEH. The broad private and institutional support which the Encyclopedia has succeeded in attracting illustrates the important catalytic role that the NEH plays in stimulating private investment in the nation's scholarly resources. This encyclopedia exemplifies the fundamental strength of the NEH. No single university's resources would have been sufficient to undertake the project. NE seed money made it possible for scholars across the nation to collaborate on a project that will vastly enrich our understanding of our nation's legal and philosophical foundations. Let me offer another instance of the NEH's contributions to the nation's cultural life. For many years the works of the greatest American authors have been buried in obscure, frequently out of print editions. Now, thanks to the leadership of Harvard's Professor Daniel Aaron and with funding from the Ford Foundation and from the NEH, our literary tradition will be accessible in an inexpensive, authoritative edition. Students, teachers, scholars, and the general public will be the beneficiaries of a project which fills a gaping hole and therefore greatly strengthens the accessibility of our national literary heritage. I cannot resist a brief reference to the Assyrian Dictionary, one of a number of important lexicographical projects on which members of our faculty at the University of Chicago are working. The Dictionary was begun in 1921. The first volume appeared in 1956, and subsequent volumes have been published steadily since then. In 1976 the Dictionary received its first grant from the NEH, and it is my understanding that the pace of work and hence also the Dictionary's availability have increased to such a point that the conclusion of the project is optimistically predicted sometime during the next decade rather than in the next century. When complete, the dictionary will provide a bridge to an hitherto little understood civilization which exerted enormous influence on near eastern history. We will be in a position to understand a great deal more about an entire civilization, indeed to help preserve it, and so to understand more about ourselves and our world at the same time. No survey, no matter how brief, of NEH's contributions to the humanities would be complete without some reference to NEH's role in strengthening the most important tool of humanistic research--the nation's libraries. The treasures of our libraries must be preserved if humanistic research is to continue in the future. The NEH has provided enormous help to libraries and archives working to conserve, preserve, and catalogue their collections. In light of these accomplishments and the widespread support that the Endowments enjoy, it is certainly unfortunate that reduced federal support for the NEH is again being proposed. Support for the NEH dropped by 14% last year--from $151.3 million in FY 1981 to $130.6 million in FY 1982. Only the exceptional leadership of this Subcommittee in the appropriations process prevented even sharper cuts in the FY 1982 funding level. We in the academic community are exceedingly grateful for this assistance. We call on your leadership once more. The Administration has proposed further drastic cuts-- amounting to more than 25%--for the NEH in FY 1983. I believe it essential that these cuts be resisted. Since their creation in 1965, the Endowments for the Arts and Humanities have received strong bipartisan support. Both Democratic and Republican Presidents have recognized the enormous public benefits derived from the relatively small sums spent on the Endowments. We cannot afford a weakening of this commitment. I am not asking the government to assume the dominant role in the support of scholarship in the humanities.

44,chi2,8/1/81,University of Chicago,Cable News Network Interview,Press,Political CT,"I don't think we yet have a sense as to which students and families that the new eligibility requirements turn them away from the loan program itself, or which students may simply be discouraged from seeking loans without understanding what the requirements are. Long-range, the effect will be to make it harder for a family of moderate means to consider high tuitions for their children. Also long-range, There could be a very serious impact on the diversity of students in certain kinds of institutions of higher education, if the worst were to come out of this. The eligibility requirements for student loans are directed especially toward families with lower income, so they will be less directly affected. On the other hand, they will have to pay higher fees in order to get loans at all, and I think that the availability of direct grants -- as opposed to loans -- which have been available for lower-income families will be somewhat dissipated. I hope that's not the case. I think that so long as we have programs in which the loans are to the students, rather than direct grants to the institutions, the opportunity for students to get such loans and to take them to the institution of their choice will help - but not entirely protect -- the opportunities for lower-income and middle-income families and students. But there could be a skewing effect; in particular, there may be a turning away from private higher education to public education by many people. The general environment we're talking about has been developing over a long period of time, 10 or 11 years. The current constraints, such as cutbacks in federal funding for education, are an intensification rather than an initiation of that.) Now for over 10 years, private higher education has been threatened by inflation, by the erosion of values in the marketplace. Therefore they can depend less on their endowments than they used to, -We are looking at an intensification of an economic circumstance which would be very much altered if inflation were to subside, for example, or if the opportunities for endowment values to rise were to be very much improved. But even so, given demographic developments (fewer young people will presumably be seeking an education), and given the impact of these 10 years and what seems to lie directly ahead, the total answer would be yes. I imagine that some institutions would be closing their doors but I don't think we'll be seeing that wholesale. I don't believe we are, no. In the case of our own institution, the University of Chicago, we're actually not seeing this kind of erosion of college board scores, and I would guess that would be true for a number of other institutions. One of the things that's happening is that a much broader and larger population is, in effect, taking those examinations, so we're. also seeing a much more diverse group of people taking them. Schools and colleges ought to prepare people well, but I don't think that what is meant by ""well"" can always be tested by college board or LSATS other forms of measurement. It's a general trend that is of concern, rather than worrying too much about a particular score. It is true that there was some loss of rigor in college curricula, as there was in school curricula, coming out of the late 60s and early 70s. I think that is beginning to turn around. Until it does, we're not going to see a great increase in these college board scores but we will see very intelligent young people who have not always been education as wel1 as they can be but who nevertheless have qualities of educational judgment, of the capacity to learn and to teach themselves which is another important thing that testing doesn't always measure. In terms of the commitment to liberal arts and genéral education, understood as a conviction that there ought to be something like a common educational experience for liberal arts undergraduates, the University of Chicago's college represents one of the leading institutions in the curriculum of this kind. We hear a great deal nowadays about the core curriculum and returning to a common core. Chicago has retained that. To describe it very briefly, all our students have about half of their undergraduate education in a general curriculum that creates that kind of common, very broad educational experience aimed at introducing them to the major approaches: to science as well as the humanities and social sciences, to language, to critical thinking, and so forth. The other half of their undergraduate education is dévoted to a flexible and often very independent kind of curriculum that ranges from concentrating in one of the traditional disciplines to a good deal of interdisciplinary study. We've reshaped and revised the curriculum over the years, but that basic commitment to liberal and general education is still our hallmark. First of all, our students/come to Chicago because they are interested in a liberal arts education. Secondly, through the experience of that curriculum, they are often confirmed and broadened in that interest. That doesn't mean they're not worried about the future or not thinking about what their professions ought to be or whether they're going to enter a professional school. What we see with our students is, on the one hand, a devotion to a liberal arts education and, on the other, an anxiety about the future and about professional choices. That conflict, or that combination, tends to mark people as they develop, and we help them to keep alive and to be strengthened by the liberal arts side of their dedication. Some are more vocationally oriented than others, but I think that we turn out liberally educated professionals where that's the case. It's a difficult question to generalize about. Certainly in the case of our institution, there was never the basic responsibility for the teaching of undergraduates to teaching assistants or young instructors. So I wouldn't say we've seen that kind of shift back, although I do think we're seeing more of our faculty renew their interest in undergraduate education. In the large universities, classes are huge; in our case, they're very small and intimate. In those large universities, we're not seeing so much of a shift as a renewed concern among many teachers for the central activity of their profession. But that doesn't mean you don't have large courses, teaching assistants, and all the rest. The question is one of the spirit in which people teach. I'd have to know the student, but if I thought he was a very bright potential computer scientist, I would tell him to major in Renaissance history because he can become a computer scientist in any case-- can take the courses, can go to graduate school in that, can become trained in. It's in college that the person interested in Renaissance history has the opportunity for learning about it, for exploring it, for doing it for its own sake, and also as a way of becoming a fuller person and taking up an interest that accompanies one throughout life. That's about the only opportunity that young computer scientist might have. I disagree with it very strongly. I don't see liberally educated young people failing to have a future. It's true that a liberal arts B.A. is not a meal ticket, but if we take the utilitarian view that a B.A. ought to be a ticket to a particular job and that not to give them that ticket is to fail, then we're talking about vocational school, not the real value of a liberal arts education. People become better in their vocations if they have a liberal arts background. The important thing is the training of critical judgment, independent-mindedness, a sense for the relatedness of issues. , If we don't have, for example, lawyers who are more than technicians —e lawyers who are also concerned about the larger political, social, ethical, and cultural consequences of their own professions, as well as doctors, bankers, computer scientists, and so forth -- then, it seems to me, we're defining very narrowly what we would hope and expect an educated person to be like. I think that Mr. Hutchins and Mr. Conant spent quite a lot of time raising funds, too, so there is no absolute contrast. Several things have happened. First, universities and colleges have become very much more complex than' they were in the 30s and 40s. The growth of the university phenomenon in this country, the explosion of knowledge, the new aspirations toward a whole variety of programs, the growth of student populations, the growth in the cost of research -- all of that has made postwar institutions of higher learning different from those of the 30s and 40s. I might argue that American higher education today is really at a higher level. Secondly, however, university and college presidents in the 70s have not been heard as much as they should be. This is not because they're people without ideas or people who should not be heard but because, to some degree, higher education has been on the defensive since the 60s. and I would like to see that turn around. Some of it had to do with the trauma of the late 60s itself, with all that meant for the questioning of universities both internally and externally and for a kind of loss of confidence in what education might do. Also it had to do with the simultaneous arrival of a severe economic and financial crisis which forced many institutions to turn increasingly toward the very painful questions of how to survive or how to come into balance. To have a balanced budget doesn't mean that you're in wonderful shape, it only means that you can then choose and control the educational purposes that you should be about. So American higher education has had something of an inward period, and if it is to justify its own mission, its own role in this society, we do have to speak out a good deal more. But that doesn't mean that we should be speaking out on every issue under the sun. It means we should be speaking out on those issues which our institutions ought to have a particular view of or a particular qualification to be talking about. We have a very distinguished department of economics. I think it has, in fact, a somewhat greater variety of internal points of view than a perception of a single ""Chicago school of economics"" allows, for. It's a somewhat more complicated and diverse set of approaches to economics than that single formula would suggest. We're really proud of the first-rate quality of economists at the University of Chicago. That's not because we endorse a given point of view in economics but because we endorse a particular quality of discovery and achievement and training that we think this department represents.. I suppose we have as many ""radicals"" as ""conservatives"" on the faculty. What we have to be concerned about is intellectual quality, and not their point of view. In this connection I have to talk, I think, about general guidelines rather than particular rules. It isn't saying anything new to say that one of the problems between institutions of higher education and government is the tension that can sometimes exist between two values, both of them important and sometimes difficult to balance against one another. Secondly, a problem is created when literal regulations are written in order to incorporate goals that are important but cannot be so easily literalized. And in that sense, yes universities and colleges have had problems vis a vis federal regulation. At the same time, I think the issues are those of trying to understand the best balance, rather than the rescinding of particular regulations. There are certain principles or values that must characterize a genuine institution of higher learning; academic freedom is one. There is a certain kind of process that has to do with the appointment of faculty or the admission of students or the freedom of people in a variety of ways, and at the same time institutions that accept government funds for all kinds of purposes should, of course, be held accountable for those funds. The question lies in how we maintain those principles of academic autonomy and freedom and at the same time introduce the appropriate criteria for assessing that accountability by the government. That is the discussion we need to have. Out of it can flow some set of recommendations about which regulations could be generalized, rewritten, or adapted to the purposes that we think they ought to serve. It's not going to happen overnight. It's a constant dialogue that ought to be possible. The civil rights legislation of the early 70s has certainly helped to stimulate and accelerate a variety of developments that I would have hoped might have taken place -- because they should -- and that otherwise might not have taken place to the same degree. I don't think the progress of women and minorities as a consequence of civil rights legislation, whether having to do with sex discrimination or equal opportunity in general, has been as full as some people had hoped. At the same time, there have been positive results. Women have made very great strides forward in higher education. There has been a great deal of progress in equal opportunity for women, equal admissions into a wide variety of areas, from medicine to law and to the formerly all-male undergraduate institutions that were not available to women before. Progress has been slower on college and university faculties, in who part because the women of my generation wou would now be senior: administrators or faculty and fewer in number. At the same time, a much larger group of younger women are now making their way through those academic careers and will very shortly be the senior administrators and faculty of the future.' I have a concern that the numbers of minority students who have chosen the academic profession, or who have felt that that profession is eitherattractive of fully accessible to them, have not grown in the same way. It has been a slower process. I believe that tenure is still the best system we have. It's a little like the Churchilian notion of democracy: many flaws, but still the best we have. That is true because underlying the principle of academic tenure and the principles of academic freedom and the necessary integrity of an academic institution. Academic tenure is not simply a form of job security; it is a condition of an autonomous environment for the scholar and teacher within a university setting. This helps not simply to protect the institution or the individual against the outside world but also to guarantee the internal conditions of the academic world. There are fewer positions now for younger scholars, whether women or minorities or white males. We're seeing it when there's a slowdown in opportunities to all younger people in the academic world. That is not because we have the institution of tenure. The reason is the demographic and economic circumstances that I referred to earlier, and I think that to feel we could get around these problems by abolishing tenure would be, in effect, to abolish the conditions that ultimately make academic life meaningful for those younger people as well. Therefore, yes; I do believe that we will be able to maintain the principle of academic tenure and should The problem of younger teachers and scholars to which you alluded is a real one. There won't be a huge population of women, minorities, or white males coming into the academic world. The essential issue is whether women and minorities have absolutely the same opportunities for those positions. I believe that classified research is inappropriate for a university campus. A university community, and the research criteria that guide it, ought to be ones in which research is open, is communicated among colleagues, is disclosed, and is published. There should be no conditions in accepting any kind of research money that would prohibit publication of the results. I think there are other kinds of institutions that are appropriate for classified research. Universities are not among them. Now, if you were to have asked me if I'd have said that in the middle of World War II, I probably would have said I'd feel differently under those conditions, but only under those conditions. No, it is not.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdTID9apTKEye_7GM4jPdpkcVgVBEUA0qOCPuZa-mvc/edit?tab=t.7xpp8186vqj3,Hanna Holborn Gray,Female,7/1/78,1127,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Chicago,IL,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",44,"I don't think we yet have a sense as to which students and families that the new eligibility requirements turn them away from the loan program itself, or which students may simply be discouraged from seeking loans without understanding what the requirements are.

Also it had to do with the simultaneous arrival of a severe economic and financial crisis which forced many institutions to turn increasingly toward the very painful questions of how to survive or how to come into balance. To have a balanced budget doesn't mean that you're in wonderful shape, it only means that you can then choose and control the educational purposes that you should be about. So American higher education has had something of an inward period, and if it is to justify its own mission, its own role in this society, we do have to speak out a good deal more. But that doesn't mean that we should be speaking out on every issue under the sun. It means we should be speaking out on those issues which our institutions ought to have a particular view of or a particular qualification to be talking about. We have a very distinguished department of economics. I think it has, in fact, a somewhat greater variety of internal points of view than a perception of a single ""Chicago school of economics"" allows, for. It's a somewhat more complicated and diverse set of approaches to economics than that single formula would suggest. We're really proud of the first-rate quality of economists at the University of Chicago. That's not because we endorse a given point of view in economics but because we endorse a particular quality of discovery and achievement and training that we think this department represents.. I suppose we have as many ""radicals"" as ""conservatives"" on the faculty. What we have to be concerned about is intellectual quality, and not their point of view. In this connection I have to talk, I think, about general guidelines rather than particular rules. It isn't saying anything new to say that one of the problems between institutions of higher education and government is the tension that can sometimes exist between two values, both of them important and sometimes difficult to balance against one another. Secondly, a problem is created when literal regulations are written in order to incorporate goals that are important but cannot be so easily literalized. And in that sense, yes universities and colleges have had problems vis a vis federal regulation. At the same time, I think the issues are those of trying to understand the best balance, rather than the rescinding of particular regulations. There are certain principles or values that must characterize a genuine institution of higher learning; academic freedom is one. There is a certain kind of process that has to do with the appointment of faculty or the admission of students or the freedom of people in a variety of ways, and at the same time institutions that accept government funds for all kinds of purposes should, of course, be held accountable for those funds. The question lies in how we maintain those principles of academic autonomy and freedom and at the same time introduce the appropriate criteria for assessing that accountability by the government. That is the discussion we need to have. Out of it can flow some set of recommendations about which regulations could be generalized, rewritten, or adapted to the purposes that we think they ought to serve. It's not going to happen overnight. It's a constant dialogue that ought to be possible. The civil rights legislation of the early 70s has certainly helped to stimulate and accelerate a variety of developments that I would have hoped might have taken place -- because they should -- and that otherwise might not have taken place to the same degree. I don't think the progress of women and minorities as a consequence of civil rights legislation, whether having to do with sex discrimination or equal opportunity in general, has been as full as some people had hoped. At the same time, there have been positive results. Women have made very great strides forward in higher education. There has been a great deal of progress in equal opportunity for women, equal admissions into a wide variety of areas, from medicine to law and to the formerly all-male undergraduate institutions that were not available to women before. Progress has been slower on college and university faculties, in who part because the women of my generation wou would now be senior: administrators or faculty and fewer in number. At the same time, a much larger group of younger women are now making their way through those academic careers and will very shortly be the senior administrators and faculty of the future.' I have a concern that the numbers of minority students who have chosen the academic profession, or who have felt that that profession is eitherattractive of fully accessible to them, have not grown in the same way. It has been a slower process. I believe that tenure is still the best system we have. It's a little like the Churchilian notion of democracy: many flaws, but still the best we have. That is true because underlying the principle of academic tenure and the principles of academic freedom and the necessary integrity of an academic institution. Academic tenure is not simply a form of job security; it is a condition of an autonomous environment for the scholar and teacher within a university setting. This helps not simply to protect the institution or the individual against the outside world but also to guarantee the internal conditions of the academic world. There are fewer positions now for younger scholars, whether women or minorities or white males. We're seeing it when there's a slowdown in opportunities to all younger people in the academic world. That is not because we have the institution of tenure. The reason is the demographic and economic circumstances that I referred to earlier, and I think that to feel we could get around these problems by abolishing tenure would be, in effect, to abolish the conditions that ultimately make academic life meaningful for those younger people as well. Therefore, yes; I do believe that we will be able to maintain the principle of academic tenure and should The problem of younger teachers and scholars to which you alluded is a real one. There won't be a huge population of women, minorities, or white males coming into the academic world. The essential issue is whether women and minorities have absolutely the same opportunities for those positions. I believe that classified research is inappropriate for a university campus. A university community, and the research criteria that guide it, ought to be ones in which research is open, is communicated among colleagues, is disclosed, and is published. There should be no conditions in accepting any kind of research money that would prohibit publication of the results. I think there are other kinds of institutions that are appropriate for classified research. Universities are not among them. Now, if you were to have asked me if I'd have said that in the middle of World War II, I probably would have said I'd feel differently under those conditions, but only under those conditions. No, it is not.",2805,0.020207254,0.015025907,0.003626943,0.007772021,0.567357513,0.007772021,0.00880829,0.00984456,0.007772021,0.004663212,0.06373057,0.002590674,0.039896373,0.024352332,0.023316062,0.098963731,0.073056995,0.005699482,0.004663212,0.010880829,0.164248705,0.054404145,0.040414508,0.740932642,8/1/81,"Reagan

45,chi3,5/15/85,University of Chicago,To the Editor of the Maroon,Press,Political CT,"I write in order to clarify the University's policy with respect to investments in corporations that do business in South Africa. Let me say at the outset that the system of apartheid practiced in South Africa is totally reprehensible. It must be condemned, and it must be ended. It is the policy of the University's Board of Trustees to invest, in the case of corporations that may do business in South Africa, only in companies that act in accordance with the Sullivan principles. The Board believes that acting as a responsible shareholder goes hand in hand with its obligations to the University's general well-being. The questions posed by investments in corporations that do business in South Africa speak to no disagreement about the goal of seeing apartheid eliminated -- for on that there is unanimity. Instead, they speak to difficult judgments, on which deeply committed and concerned people may and do differ, as to the means for its accomplishment. Those who argue for total divestiture maintain that any such investments are wrong because no company should operate at all in South Africa. This view holds that such involvement is in itself a support to the system of apartheid and an implication in its evils, and that divestiture is a means to the end of doing away with apartheid and to separating the investing institution from any association with it. Another point of view, which the University's Trustees have adopted, is that the role to be played by responsible corporations doing business in South Africa is one of pursuing, in the face of apartheid, policies in the workplace diametrically opposed to the system by introducing fair employment practices and equal rights for their workers.

46,chi4,4/2/79,University of Chicago,Divestiture of Investments in South Africa,Message,Political CT,"In February of last year, the Trustees of the University of Chicago communicated to the University community their conclusions on the matter of ""divestiture"" - that is, on the proposal that the University should divest itself of all stocks held in companies that do business in South Africa. The Board declared itself opposed to such divestiture. At the same time the Board enunciated its policy governing the voting of proxies, which instructs the Treasurer of the University to examine each stockholder proposal and management's reply with careful consideration of the issue raised and of management's intent. 1) If the management position is constructive and responsible, the proxy will be voted for management. 2) In other cases, the proposals will be submitted to the Investment Committee for approval or disapproval. The following statement is intended, after a further review of the relevant issues, to set forward and clarify the reasoning behind these conclusions and to explain more broadly the Trustees' position on the University's investment policy. Divestiture is only one of the steps that have been urged on universities as a means of demonstrating condemnation of the South African regime and of affecting the course of events in that country. In considering the complex of questions that attach to the University's investment policy and its application to the moral and political problems posed by the present situation in South Africa, the Trustees have discussed also what measures other than divestiture have been advanced and what different points of view have been argued. The Trustees share unequivocally the conviction that the system of apartheid is fundamentally evil and that its institutionalization of racial discrimination creates an extreme of injustice that makes the South African instance one for critical concern. The questions before us are difficult ones of judgment as to the process by which, in the South African situation, change can come about and as to the role in that process which may be appropriate for the University to play in its capacity as a shareholder. On these issues there are differences of view within the University, as there are externally and indeed among South African opponents of apartheid as well. The impact and outcome which various actions would have is uncertain and highly controversial. We have sought to inform ourselves of the positions taken by many groups and individuals, and of the arguments that lie behind them. Ultimately, taking into account the substance of deeply held and often conflicting judgments, we have had to make our own best judgment. In doing so, we have taken into account also our duty to the basic character and purposes of the University and our fiduciary responsibilities as Trustees. Trustees, who are charged with responsibility for investments, are legally bound by the ""prudent man"" rule of fiduciary responsibility, a statutorily defined standard of conduct that governs the role of trustees in general and which requires university trustees to ensure the capacity of the institution to perform the basic (and circumscribed) tasks for which it exists and for the fulfilment of which its endowment has been given. Trustees may consider the ""social performance"" of a corporation in deciding the wisdom of buying or keeping its stock. But economic return and the preservation of principle are the guiding objectives to which trustees are bound in their stewardship of the institution's investments. The basic mission of the university, the purpose to which its endowment is pledged, is the discovery, improvement, and dissemination of knowledge through teaching and research. The university as a corporate entity is limited to those purposes, however broad and significant they may be, and its activities must always be shaped by them. The Kalven Committee, reporting in 1967, articulated the major principles which continue to define the University's proper role in relation to ""To perform its mission in the society, a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures. A university, if it is to be true to its faith in intellectual inquiry, must embrace, be hospitable to and encourage the widest diversity of views within its own community. It is a community but only for the limited, albeit great, purposes of teaching and research. Since the University is a community only for these limited and distinctive purposes, community which cannot take collective action on the issues of the day without endangering the conditions for its existence and effectiveness. There is no mechanism by which it can reach a collective position without inhibiting that full freedom of dissent on which it thrives. It cannot insist that all of its members favor a given view of social policy; if it takes collective action, therefore, it does so at the price of censuring any minority who do not agree with the view adopted. In brief, it is a community which cannot resort to majority vote to reach positions on public issues. … this neutrality as an institution has its complement in the fullest freedom for its faculty and students as individuals to participate in political action and social protest. It finds it complement, too, in the obligation of the university to provide a forum for the most searching and candid discussion of public issues. … From time to time instances will arise in which the society, or segments of it, threaten the very mission of the university and its values of free inquiry. In such a crisis, it becomes the obligation of the university as an institution to oppose such measures and actively to defend its interests and its values. There is another context in which questions as to the appropriate role of the university may possibly arise, situations involving university ownership of property, its receipt of funds, its awarding of honors, its membership in other organizations. Here, of necessity, the university, however it acts, must act as an institution in its corporate capacity. In the exceptional instance, these corporate activities of the university may appear so incompatible with paramount social values as to require careful assessment of the consequences. These extraordinary instances apart, there emerges, as we see it, a heavy presumption against the university taking collective action or expressing opinions on the political and social issues of the day, or modifying its corporate activities to foster social or political values, however compelling and appealing they may be."" We turn now to the question as to how best to deal with investments in companies which do business in South Africa. There are those who argue for divestiture on the grounds that the University should not as a shareholder be implicated in any activity which may be seen as supporting the evils of apartheid and that the presence of U.S. companies in South Africa constitutes such support. The argument so stated is for withdrawal of U.S. Corporations from any business in South Africa, and at any rate for the separation of the University from holding shares and deriving income from the business of such companies. It is argued, too, that divestiture by the university would have the effect of hastening such withdrawal, of influencing other institutions to similar divestment, and of weakening the South African economy or even helping to bring about the fall of the regime and aiding the cause of revolution inSouth Africa. We are not persuaded of this line of reasoning. On the contrary, we subscribe to the cautious hope that the presence of U.S. corporations in South Africa may represent some potential for constructive and peaceful change in that country and may at the very least help to improve the lot of black workers. To suggest that one should support the withdrawal of U.S. companies in order to provoke racial confrontation and violent revolution is not, we think, the right course. To urge withdrawal would also be to sanction the hardship and suffering which could be experienced by black workers who would become unemployed or who might be forced to work for employers far less concerned with improved conditions of employment. Were U.S. companies to withdraw, one important opportunity for pursuing policies that could help alleviate the conditions of life for individuals would go with them. These considerations speak to our belief that U.S. companies doing business in South Africa may and should act as responsible forces in a process of social change and may help to set an influential example. Many of these companies have subscribed to the principles of conduct set out by the Reverend Leon Sullivan. They are: 1. Non-segregation of the races in all eating, comfort and work facilities. 2. Equal and fair employment practices for all employees. 3. Equal pay for all employees doing equal or comparable work for the same period of time. 4. Initiation of and development of training programs that will prepare in substantial numbers, Blacks and other non-Whites for supervisory, administrative, clerical and technical jobs. 5. Increasing the number of Blacks and other non-Whites in management and supervisory positions. 6. Improving the quality of employees' lives outside the work environment in such areas as housing, transportation, schooling, recreating and health facilities. The Sullivan principles represent one set of guidelines against which to measure the conduct of individual companies, their commitment to fundamental human regrets as practiced in their business activities. Those are the kinds of criteria which responsible shareholders should seek to see realized in U.S. companies wherever they operate. For the University to divest itself of all its holdings in companies that do business in South Africa would not, we think, have the consequences of bringing pressure to bear either on other institutions to do likewise or on the corporations whose shares were being sold. The university would have sacrificed any influence its voice as a shareholder might otherwise possess, and shares so disposed of could easily be purchased by others who might be far less concerned with issues of human rights. And the costs of divestment, expended for so little consequence, would be significant. The Treasurer's office has made an analysis of the estimated costs to the University that would be incurred through such action, and they would be serious divestiture of the securities of companies with financial dealings or operations in South Africa would affect $84 million or 28% of the University's total endowment portfolio and at least 39% of the equity portion of the portfolio. The cost of selling the securities and reinvesting the proceeds would be between $2.1 million and $3.6 million. Brokerage charges, custodian fees, and transfer taxes are estimated to be a minimum of $725,000 and a maximum of $800,000 on this volume of securities. The sale and repurchase of securities would involve the cost of the bid-and-asked spread, or some portion of it, and would amount to a minimum of $1.3 million and a maximum of $2.4 million. It should also be noted that the University earned approximately $300,000 annually by lending securities and investing the collateral during the period of the loan. Divestiture would create a substantially less loanable portfolio which would result in a loss of some portion of the $300,000. In sum, the Trustees believe that a withdrawal of American investments from South Africa would not be in the best interest of Black South Africans. They beli-ve that a divestment decision by The University of Chicago would have no significant impact on American enterprises active in South Africa. And they believe that divestment could not take place without seriously impairing the University's ability to perform its basic educational mission. For these reasons, the Trustees remain opposed to divestment. At the same time, the Trustees believe that they and the other members of the University community cannot ignore problems in South Africa. For that reason, the Crustees determined last year that in its role as an investor the University would scrutinize proxy resolutions on a case by case basis. Beyond the issue of investment policy there lies the question as to what contribution a university, in its educational capacity, may bring to the reversal of the violation of human rights in South Africa. It is surely proper for the University to offer a forum for the analysis and discussion of those issues. It is important, too, that intensive study and understanding of South African society in all its related dimensions be advanced. This the University is uniquely suited to encourage. And the University must speak to the priorities of academic freedom and of equal educational opportunities for all and must seek out the ways by which universities may further such ends.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdTID9apTKEye_7GM4jPdpkcVgVBEUA0qOCPuZa-mvc/edit?tab=t.p1iarav4eycn,Hanna Holborn Gray,Female,7/1/78,275,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Chicago,IL,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",46,"In February of last year, the Trustees of the University of Chicago communicated to the University community their conclusions on the matter of ""divestiture"" - that is, on the proposal that the University should divest itself of all stocks held in companies that do business in South Africa.

The university would have sacrificed any influence its voice as a shareholder might otherwise possess, and shares so disposed of could easily be purchased by others who might be far less concerned with issues of human rights. And the costs of divestment, expended for so little consequence, would be significant. The Treasurer's office has made an analysis of the estimated costs to the University that would be incurred through such action, and they would be serious divestiture of the securities of companies with financial dealings or operations in South Africa would affect $84 million or 28% of the University's total endowment portfolio and at least 39% of the equity portion of the portfolio. The cost of selling the securities and reinvesting the proceeds would be between $2.1 million and $3.6 million. Brokerage charges, custodian fees, and transfer taxes are estimated to be a minimum of $725,000 and a maximum of $800,000 on this volume of securities. The sale and repurchase of securities would involve the cost of the bid-and-asked spread, or some portion of it, and would amount to a minimum of $1.3 million and a maximum of $2.4 million. It should also be noted that the University earned approximately $300,000 annually by lending securities and investing the collateral during the period of the loan. Divestiture would create a substantially less loanable portfolio which would result in a loss of some portion of the $300,000. In sum, the Trustees believe that a withdrawal of American investments from South Africa would not be in the best interest of Black South Africans. They beli-ve that a divestment decision by The University of Chicago would have no significant impact on American enterprises active in South Africa. And they believe that divestment could not take place without seriously impairing the University's ability to perform its basic educational mission. For these reasons, the Trustees remain opposed to divestment. At the same time, the Trustees believe that they and the other members of the University community cannot ignore problems in South Africa. For that reason, the Crustees determined last year that in its role as an investor the University would scrutinize proxy resolutions on a case by case basis. Beyond the issue of investment policy there lies the question as to what contribution a university, in its educational capacity, may bring to the reversal of the violation of human rights in South Africa. It is surely proper for the University to offer a forum for the analysis and discussion of those issues. It is important, too, that intensive study and understanding of South African society in all its related dimensions be advanced. This the University is uniquely suited to encourage. And the University must speak to the priorities of academic freedom and of equal educational opportunities for all and must seek out the ways by which universities may further such ends.",2106,0.0336374,0.008551881,0.00627138,0.011972634,0.159064994,0.008551881,0.008551881,0.027936146,0.014253136,0.017673888,0.00627138,0.023375143,0.051881414,0.018814139,0.017673888,0.111174458,0.027936146,0.423603193,0.008551881,0.014253136,0.595781072,0.072405929,0.077537058,0.254275941,4/2/79,"Reagan

48,chi6,4/24/85,University of Chicago,Transcript of Interview with University President Hanna Gray on Tuition and Financial Aid,Press,Campus CT,"For several reasons, the first of which you've mentioned: the costs of education go up at a rate higher than the rate of inflation. The second has to do with the fact that certain sources of support are declining. If we are to be able to maintain our financial aid policy, for example, and do as we ought in unrestricted financial aid, we have to make up through unrestricted revenues for moneys that have declined in real terms elsewhere. For example, given the level of federal years ago, there was probably five million dollars more available in direct student support that is no longer there. yAnd so you have he choice: Do you make up that five million dollars in order to maintain and if possible strengthen student financial aid at the University? The decision that we have made is that that is an overwhelming priority--to maintain access to the University for the very best having to modify a policy of admissions and financial aid that is responsive to every Now you see the same qualified student. Faculty thing happening in other support. think it's important that the which is again a central part of the unrestricted budget, should be good and should be strengthened after a period true that the compensation for faculty declined in real tried to go a little ahead of that inflationary rate--not wildly ahead, but in such a way as to give appropriate compensation to a first-rate faculty. I think you'll agree that that's a very important priority, and so there is an important need improving faculty again external support are no longer of to be , for example, that through federal grants and salary support for faculty compensation which has lapsed--that's about another two million dollars. So just in the last five years in these two areas which are critical to University policy, we've seen a loss or decline of revenue that used to help support those priorities. area has to do with the facilities that have come into being on the campus: the new Physics Teaching Center, the renovation of Kent, the Crerar Library, and similar facilities have created needs for financing of such facilities. We think again that they're key to the teaching and research programs of the University, to the quality of education here. We also think that such modernization is essential to the level of education and research that can be performed at the University. Again, those are not So those I think are the principal areas of explanation that I would give you. There are some others around the edges--that is, there are other areas where other kinds of revenue are not growing at the same rate as the real costs of education. Let me say just one other thing. Chicago had and has a somewhat lower tuition than do most colleges within research universities. That means that in effect the tuition charged was paying for a smaller proportion of the cost of that student's education at the University. That proportion is still less than half. It's true in any University like ours with a college that the student is paying about half or less of the real cost of education. We don't think, in other words, that we can afford to have the student pay a whole lot less than half, and so that's been more or less our measure. I don't think we're in effect closing it. I think we're keeping more or less even, because lower institutions of course produce more higher dollars on a higher base than that we percentage increases on our lower base. So would say wider. Have only slightly but And have kept it from growing that's also students here the unimportant, in terms of being able to offer Kind of similar institutions experience and the kind of aid want afford their that other students. One thing we're clear about is that the gap should not widen again. I don't think that's wise, Particularly with our very small college, which we want to maintain as a place of of smaller classes with a teaching faculty accessible to students. That is a very Expensive form of education. A lot of institutions do a lot of their teaching with either very large classes or a very large battalion of teaching assistants, and we don't do it that way. We don't have a particular plan to close the gap in real terms, but we're continuing to see that that gap doesn't grow, and if possible, perhaps closing it slightly--at the same time being sure that the financial aid is adequate with any increase and secondly that our students are in fact getting a good education with these facilities. These priorities are ones that speak to their educational objectives as well as to the quality of the institution as a whole. We don't want to see that kind of increase. I think it's likely to grow a little bit as a percentage of unrestricted [revenue] until such time as other revenue sources can grow again to help that. But as you know, one is seeing a time when there is less in the way of external funding for those two all-important purposes available. While that remains true, tuition is likely--even if it were kept flat--to represent a higher--but I hope not excessively high--proportion of unrestricted revenue. We worry about that all the time--whether that price will either be or be seen as an obstacle to coming to the University or remaining at the University. I think that we have to be creative and inventive about other forms of loan programs and so on that will be helpful both to students and their parents. I think that in this coming period of time when one cannot imagine that the federally-insured student loan program, for example, is going to be as helpful as it was, that becomes even more important. Yes. If every cut that was proposed went through, no one could afford to maintain a need-blind admissions policy, I believe, because the gap between what the university would have available and what had at one time been available externally would simply be too great for any institution to absorb. It's my hope that those proposals can be sufficiently modified so that we can help to make up some of the difference that inevitably may exist. For example, even a flattening out of that budget at the federal level would put a greater burden on us. We’re going to do everything we can both to see to it that the proposals will be modified (we’re working on our own and with other institutions and associations in the hope that we can all have some influence) and secondly to do everything that we can to maintain that policy internally. No, I don’t. I think that for the past year, it’s just below ten percent, and there was of course a much higher inflation rate in those earlier years. I would anticipate that that percentage rate would come down a bit. Yes, there a number of such programs, and I think we should look at everything, including that one. That's something we mean to look at. I really don't have a conclusion about it yet, but we're going to look at a whole series of alternative tuition/financial aid programs in order to see how to put those things best together. I would characterize it as very sound and at the same time very tight. institution, in being ambitious as it ought to be, always has use for more resources than are available to it. It doesn't have an enormous base of endowment; it has a good base of endowment. It's a small university, which means that we have in effect a very expensive form of education, given the large faculty and the relatively small number of students. I would say that our financial situation is better than it was five years ago in the sense that I think there have been built into the things that we're doing and into the budget base for what we're doing a number of real improvements both in the facilities and programs side and in the ongoing financing of things that universities always need to pay attention to. You can always have a balanced budget and fail to maintain your buildings. But I think that our balance between financial responsibility and responsibility for maintaining the integrity of what you need to do - - whether in terms of facilities or in terms of library acquisitions and so on - - is one that is good. We have done quite well in fundraising. Fundraising doesn't make up the gap that you see, of course, but it's essential to our well being. And I think that [in terms of] the financial management of the university, we have the good fortune of having extremely good people who are doing very well. On the other hand, as you look at what's happening out there in Washington, what's happening in the economy for academic institutions more generally, as you look at the condition of a University that has very extensive programs and very expensive programs, it's not easy. The growth of the expense base and the growth of the revenue stream are not always in equilibrium, so we have to worry about that quite a lot. Now this it seems to me' is probably the state of the academic economy, and we're one of the strongest institutions. At the same time, we look at those problems and of course we feel them. We're continuing to look at ways to improve efficiency and productivity We continue to look at ways in which to increase our in our operations. fundraising capacity, to increase the revenues that are available to us, to look at ways to slow down the growth of expenditures. Obviously we have to look at ways to keep the size of the commitments of the University from growing beyond what can be permanently supported. Therefore, it’s programmatic, it's managerial, and it also looks at revenue enhancement where that's possible. To some degree, of course, you can't control what happens externally, and there have some surprises along the way. You can’t control what the ultimate outcome is going to be in budgetary terms, for example in the Congress what is going to happen to the revenue stream that comes from indirect cost recoveries, or student aid budgets and so on on the outside. On the other hand I think we've done reasonably well so far in assimilating those shocks, and there are areas where the University has done spectacularly well-for example in utilities and energy conservation that have to do with the investment of University cash and so on that have helped to increase he revenue available to the University; and also in some reductions here and there across the University of things that were less central to our strength. It's a continuing of all those kinds of strategies. The Hospitals and Clinics are what we call auxiliary enterprises. That means they are not part of the unrestricted budget of the University. Like the book store, the parking system, and the University Press these are entities that have to come in within budget, and they are surpluses or deficits to deal with over time. So you can think of them as tubs on their own bottoms rather than as entities that are supported by the unrestricted budget of the University. In that sense, the Hospitals and Clinics are not a threat to the academic budget of the University. The Hospitals and Clinics are experiencing the problems that hospitals and, above all, academic health centers are experiencing nowadays. These are the result of changes that have come very rapidly in the past two years involving a heightened consciousness and set of policies looking toward cost containment in the health delivery system across the nation: changes in the reimbursement levels and policies have affected very seriously the income of hospitals, as have some shift between hospital care and ambulatory care, a decrease in the census that hospitals are experiencing, and some decrease in the number of days that patients usually remain in hospitals. It's very difficult to make an instant adjustment to these major changes, and what you're seeing in the Hospitals and Clinics, where there was a $ 3.5 million deficit this past year (which is not a charge on the unrestricted budget of the University, but which is a charge on the Hospital budget which is going to have to finance that over time ) is a result of these very rapid shifts--above all in reimbursement policy. When you think of our Hospitals, where we have 50 percent or even slightly more patients who are under Medicaid or Medicare, and you think of the changes in the reimbursements for Medicare and Medicaid, which don't fully reimburse the cost of such patient care and which are [now being cut back further] from those levels of payment which they were responsible for, you can imagine very quickly how that shift would affect Hospital income. And when you think then further of that change in Hospital census, the number of days, and all the rest, it makes it still clearer. Also, a teaching hospital is likely to be responsible for patients who require the most expensive kinds of care--a tertiary care hospital. Therefore, that gap between the cost of treatment and what Medicare/Medicaid will reimburse is likely to be still greater. A teaching hospital also has a large house staff, and therefore the number of people in the hospital--including that large resident staff of new doctors and postgraduate students--again means that the cost base of such a hospital is much higher. You can't just suddenly do without a house staff, you can't just suddenly withdraw from a commitment to that kind of education. And so what we're seeing in the Hospitals and Clinics are the consequences of all these shifts that are taking place, that are affecting academic medical centers in particular, and that affect a center such as ours with its high proportion of care for the indigent and for patients who are covered by Medicare and Medicaid. There's also a certain amount of free care that goes on in the Hospitals, for poor people who really can’t pay and who may have no insurance at all. Those are the basic elements in the situation, and obviously it is a matter of great concern, and obviously if it went on for years and years it would have a significant effect on the University as a whole, because if the Hospital couldn’t pay back the loans that it needs from the University cash in order to manage – loans that repaid with interest so that the unrestricted budget is not subsidizing the Hospital - - then over time of course that would be a very serious situation, but that’s not a situation we expect. We do not anticipate a long term deficit in the hospital; we anticipate that we are going to have to absorb these shocks, but that the planning going on and the measures being taken will bring the hospital budget back to balance, we hope next year and certainly no later than the year after. Well, let me say unequivocally that we are not going to change the research policies of this University. Research must be open, must be unclassified--those are absolute principles so far as this University is concerned, and those are principles that are not going to be violated. There are certain kinds of money that are not worth having, and this University will continue to abide by that principle, because otherwise it wouldn't be the kind of University that we want and that its people are committed to. That's not going to change. Now the debate over the proposal to have a research institute in mathematics that Would be funded by the Army isn't really a debate over whether we are all in favor of those principles. It’s a debate over a source of funding which to some people, because of the defense relationship, is regarded with suspicion; by others, it with suspicion feel association with defense is potentially corrupting; those who do not regard it with suspicion believe that it is Clear that the research division of the Department of Defense will contractually recognize the conditions under which research would be performed here--indeed we would absolutely ensure that. There is a long tradition of Department of Defense support for mathematics, a great deal of pure mathematics has been done under the auspices of the Department of Defense without any political implications, results, or consequences whatsoever. That we don't know that or believe that that is an all important thing to preserve--I think that genuinely that is not an issue. But there are of course people who are concerned that those potentialities are always out there. There's always the potentiality for abusing knowledge or being too zealous in the pursuit of money. Our job, all of us--faculty and administration alike--is to see that neither of those things happen. So I don't believe that we're out there looking for grants and contracts at all costs--we're not. And I don't believe that we're ever going to be doing what would be called defense work or classified work. There are of course many discoveries made in the pursuit of pure research that may have some applicability in a whole variety of ways that we don't know. The fact that that may turn out to be the case should not, I think, deter anybody from pursuing knowledge. The performance has been good recently. The Campaign for the Arts and Sciences is a campaign that is going along well. It is a slogging campaign. It's the hardest kind of campaign because making the case for that intangible thing called the Arts and Sciences, the Liberal arts--making the case for those values is always the difficult in a certain way, where people are less likely to see the mediate or tangible results or consequences, or where they may have less of a relationship to a given professional field. So it's a campaign at which one has to work very hard, and at the same time, it's about where it ought to be. It's not ahead of where it ought to be, it's about where it ought to be and I think it will be concluded on time and have a very good effect. As you know, campaigns of that kind don't bring in all that money right away because the larger gifts tend to be pledges that are paid in over a longer period of time. But the central objectives of scholarship support, fellowship support, faculty support, research funds, are those that we're working hardest at and we've had some very good results. I expect that we'll be halfway through by the end of the fiscal year, certainly by the Fall.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sdTID9apTKEye_7GM4jPdpkcVgVBEUA0qOCPuZa-mvc/edit?tab=t.9gf9uwy1qeiq,Hanna Holborn Gray,Female,7/1/78,2489,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Reagan & South Africa Apartheid,1/1/74,12/31/86,Private non-religious,Chicago,IL,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",48,"For several reasons, the first of which you've mentioned: the costs of education go up at a rate higher than the rate of inflation. The second has to do with the fact that certain sources of support are declining. If we are to be able to maintain our financial aid policy, for example, and do as we ought in unrestricted financial aid, we have to make up through unrestricted revenues for moneys that have declined in real terms elsewhere. For example, given the level of federal years ago, there was probably five million dollars more available in direct student support that is no longer there. yAnd so you have he choice: Do you make up that five million dollars in order to maintain and if possible strengthen student financial aid at the University? The decision that we have made is that that is an overwhelming priority--to maintain access to the University for the very best having to modify a policy of admissions and financial aid that is responsive to every Now you see the same qualified student. Faculty thing happening in other support. think it's important that the which is again a central part of the unrestricted budget, should be good and should be strengthened after a period true that the compensation for faculty declined in real tried to go a little ahead of that inflationary rate--not wildly ahead, but in such a way as to give appropriate compensation to a first-rate faculty. I think you'll agree that that's a very important priority, and so there is an important need improving faculty again external support are no longer of to be , for example, that through federal grants and salary support for faculty compensation which has lapsed--that's about another two million dollars. So just in the last five years in these two areas which are critical to University policy, we've seen a loss or decline of revenue that used to help support those priorities. area has to do with the facilities that have come into being on the campus: the new Physics Teaching Center, the renovation of Kent, the Crerar Library, and similar facilities have created needs for financing of such facilities. We think again that they're key to the teaching and research programs of the University, to the quality of education here. We also think that such modernization is essential to the level of education and research that can be performed at the University. Again, those are not So those I think are the principal areas of explanation that I would give you. There are some others around the edges--that is, there are other areas where other kinds of revenue are not growing at the same rate as the real costs of education. Let me say just one other thing. Chicago had and has a somewhat lower tuition than do most colleges within research universities. That means that in effect the tuition charged was paying for a smaller proportion of the cost of that student's education at the University. That proportion is still less than half. It's true in any University like ours with a college that the student is paying about half or less of the real cost of education. We don't think, in other words, that we can afford to have the student pay a whole lot less than half, and so that's been more or less our measure. I don't think we're in effect closing it. I think we're keeping more or less even, because lower institutions of course produce more higher dollars on a higher base than that we percentage increases on our lower base. So would say wider. Have only slightly but And have kept it from growing that's also students here the unimportant, in terms of being able to offer Kind of similar institutions experience and the kind of aid want afford their that other students. One thing we're clear about is that the gap should not widen again. I don't think that's wise, Particularly with our very small college, which we want to maintain as a place of of smaller classes with a teaching faculty accessible to students. That is a very Expensive form of education. A lot of institutions do a lot of their teaching with either very large classes or a very large battalion of teaching assistants, and we don't do it that way. We don't have a particular plan to close the gap in real terms, but we're continuing to see that that gap doesn't grow, and if possible, perhaps closing it slightly--at the same time being sure that the financial aid is adequate with any increase and secondly that our students are in fact getting a good education with these facilities. These priorities are ones that speak to their educational objectives as well as to the quality of the institution as a whole. We don't want to see that kind of increase. I think it's likely to grow a little bit as a percentage of unrestricted [revenue] until such time as other revenue sources can grow again to help that. But as you know, one is seeing a time when there is less in the way of external funding for those two all-important purposes available. While that remains true, tuition is likely--even if it were kept flat--to represent a higher--but I hope not excessively high--proportion of unrestricted revenue. We worry about that all the time--whether that price will either be or be seen as an obstacle to coming to the University or remaining at the University. I think that we have to be creative and inventive about other forms of loan programs and so on that will be helpful both to students and their parents. I think that in this coming period of time when one cannot imagine that the federally-insured student loan program, for example, is going to be as helpful as it was, that becomes even more important. Yes. If every cut that was proposed went through, no one could afford to maintain a need-blind admissions policy, I believe, because the gap between what the university would have available and what had at one time been available externally would simply be too great for any institution to absorb. It's my hope that those proposals can be sufficiently modified so that we can help to make up some of the difference that inevitably may exist. For example, even a flattening out of that budget at the federal level would put a greater burden on us. We’re going to do everything we can both to see to it that the proposals will be modified (we’re working on our own and with other institutions and associations in the hope that we can all have some influence) and secondly to do everything that we can to maintain that policy internally. No, I don’t. I think that for the past year, it’s just below ten percent, and there was of course a much higher inflation rate in those earlier years. I would anticipate that that percentage rate would come down a bit. Yes, there a number of such programs, and I think we should look at everything, including that one. That's something we mean to look at. I really don't have a conclusion about it yet, but we're going to look at a whole series of alternative tuition/financial aid programs in order to see how to put those things best together. I would characterize it as very sound and at the same time very tight. institution, in being ambitious as it ought to be, always has use for more resources than are available to it. It doesn't have an enormous base of endowment; it has a good base of endowment. It's a small university, which means that we have in effect a very expensive form of education, given the large faculty and the relatively small number of students. I would say that our financial situation is better than it was five years ago in the sense that I think there have been built into the things that we're doing and into the budget base for what we're doing a number of real improvements both in the facilities and programs side and in the ongoing financing of things that universities always need to pay attention to. You can always have a balanced budget and fail to maintain your buildings. But I think that our balance between financial responsibility and responsibility for maintaining the integrity of what you need to do - - whether in terms of facilities or in terms of library acquisitions and so on - - is one that is good. We have done quite well in fundraising. Fundraising doesn't make up the gap that you see, of course, but it's essential to our well being. And I think that [in terms of] the financial management of the university, we have the good fortune of having extremely good people who are doing very well. On the other hand, as you look at what's happening out there in Washington, what's happening in the economy for academic institutions more generally, as you look at the condition of a University that has very extensive programs and very expensive programs, it's not easy. The growth of the expense base and the growth of the revenue stream are not always in equilibrium, so we have to worry about that quite a lot. Now this it seems to me' is probably the state of the academic economy, and we're one of the strongest institutions. At the same time, we look at those problems and of course we feel them. We're continuing to look at ways to improve efficiency and productivity We continue to look at ways in which to increase our in our operations. fundraising capacity, to increase the revenues that are available to us, to look at ways to slow down the growth of expenditures. Obviously we have to look at ways to keep the size of the commitments of the University from growing beyond what can be permanently supported. Therefore, it’s programmatic, it's managerial, and it also looks at revenue enhancement where that's possible. To some degree, of course, you can't control what happens externally, and there have some surprises along the way. You can’t control what the ultimate outcome is going to be in budgetary terms, for example in the Congress what is going to happen to the revenue stream that comes from indirect cost recoveries, or student aid budgets and so on on the outside. On the other hand I think we've done reasonably well so far in assimilating those shocks, and there are areas where the University has done spectacularly well-for example in utilities and energy conservation that have to do with the investment of University cash and so on that have helped to increase he revenue available to the University; and also in some reductions here and there across the University of things that were less central to our strength. It's a continuing of all those kinds of strategies. The Hospitals and Clinics are what we call auxiliary enterprises. That means they are not part of the unrestricted budget of the University. Like the book store, the parking system, and the University Press these are entities that have to come in within budget, and they are surpluses or deficits to deal with over time. So you can think of them as tubs on their own bottoms rather than as entities that are supported by the unrestricted budget of the University. In that sense, the Hospitals and Clinics are not a threat to the academic budget of the University. The Hospitals and Clinics are experiencing the problems that hospitals and, above all, academic health centers are experiencing nowadays. These are the result of changes that have come very rapidly in the past two years involving a heightened consciousness and set of policies looking toward cost containment in the health delivery system across the nation: changes in the reimbursement levels and policies have affected very seriously the income of hospitals, as have some shift between hospital care and ambulatory care, a decrease in the census that hospitals are experiencing, and some decrease in the number of days that patients usually remain in hospitals. It's very difficult to make an instant adjustment to these major changes, and what you're seeing in the Hospitals and Clinics, where there was a $ 3.5 million deficit this past year (which is not a charge on the unrestricted budget of the University, but which is a charge on the Hospital budget which is going to have to finance that over time ) is a result of these very rapid shifts--above all in reimbursement policy. When you think of our Hospitals, where we have 50 percent or even slightly more patients who are under Medicaid or Medicare, and you think of the changes in the reimbursements for Medicare and Medicaid, which don't fully reimburse the cost of such patient care and which are [now being cut back further] from those levels of payment which they were responsible for, you can imagine very quickly how that shift would affect Hospital income. And when you think then further of that change in Hospital census, the number of days, and all the rest, it makes it still clearer. Also, a teaching hospital is likely to be responsible for patients who require the most expensive kinds of care--a tertiary care hospital. Therefore, that gap between the cost of treatment and what Medicare/Medicaid will reimburse is likely to be still greater. A teaching hospital also has a large house staff, and therefore the number of people in the hospital--including that large resident staff of new doctors and postgraduate students--again means that the cost base of such a hospital is much higher. You can't just suddenly do without a house staff, you can't just suddenly withdraw from a commitment to that kind of education. And so what we're seeing in the Hospitals and Clinics are the consequences of all these shifts that are taking place, that are affecting academic medical centers in particular, and that affect a center such as ours with its high proportion of care for the indigent and for patients who are covered by Medicare and Medicaid. There's also a certain amount of free care that goes on in the Hospitals, for poor people who really can’t pay and who may have no insurance at all. Those are the basic elements in the situation, and obviously it is a matter of great concern, and obviously if it went on for years and years it would have a significant effect on the University as a whole, because if the Hospital couldn’t pay back the loans that it needs from the University cash in order to manage – loans that repaid with interest so that the unrestricted budget is not subsidizing the Hospital - - then over time of course that would be a very serious situation, but that’s not a situation we expect. We do not anticipate a long term deficit in the hospital; we anticipate that we are going to have to absorb these shocks, but that the planning going on and the measures being taken will bring the hospital budget back to balance, we hope next year and certainly no later than the year after. Well, let me say unequivocally that we are not going to change the research policies of this University. Research must be open, must be unclassified--those are absolute principles so far as this University is concerned, and those are principles that are not going to be violated. There are certain kinds of money that are not worth having, and this University will continue to abide by that principle, because otherwise it wouldn't be the kind of University that we want and that its people are committed to. That's not going to change. Now the debate over the proposal to have a research institute in mathematics that Would be funded by the Army isn't really a debate over whether we are all in favor of those principles. It’s a debate over a source of funding which to some people, because of the defense relationship, is regarded with suspicion; by others, it with suspicion feel association with defense is potentially corrupting; those who do not regard it with suspicion believe that it is Clear that the research division of the Department of Defense will contractually recognize the conditions under which research would be performed here--indeed we would absolutely ensure that. There is a long tradition of Department of Defense support for mathematics, a great deal of pure mathematics has been done under the auspices of the Department of Defense without any political implications, results, or consequences whatsoever. That we don't know that or believe that that is an all important thing to preserve--I think that genuinely that is not an issue. But there are of course people who are concerned that those potentialities are always out there. There's always the potentiality for abusing knowledge or being too zealous in the pursuit of money. Our job, all of us--faculty and administration alike--is to see that neither of those things happen. So I don't believe that we're out there looking for grants and contracts at all costs--we're not. And I don't believe that we're ever going to be doing what would be called defense work or classified work. There are of course many discoveries made in the pursuit of pure research that may have some applicability in a whole variety of ways that we don't know. The fact that that may turn out to be the case should not, I think, deter anybody from pursuing knowledge. The performance has been good recently. The Campaign for the Arts and Sciences is a campaign that is going along well. It is a slogging campaign. It's the hardest kind of campaign because making the case for that intangible thing called the Arts and Sciences, the Liberal arts--making the case for those values is always the difficult in a certain way, where people are less likely to see the mediate or tangible results or consequences, or where they may have less of a relationship to a given professional field. So it's a campaign at which one has to work very hard, and at the same time, it's about where it ought to be. It's not ahead of where it ought to be, it's about where it ought to be and I think it will be concluded on time and have a very good effect. As you know, campaigns of that kind don't bring in all that money right away because the larger gifts tend to be pledges that are paid in over a longer period of time. But the central objectives of scholarship support, fellowship support, faculty support, research funds, are those that we're working hardest at and we've had some very good results. I expect that we'll be halfway through by the end of the fiscal year, certainly by the Fall.",3258,0.016700405,0.017712551,0.008603239,0.007591093,0.799089069,0.006578947,0.013663968,0.004554656,0.002530364,0.013663968,0.011639676,0.002530364,0.008603239,0.006578947,0.005566802,0.034919028,0.009615385,0.009615385,0.008603239,0.011639676,0.085526316,0.028846154,0.021255061,0.86437247,4/24/85,"Reagan

50,umi2,11/5/90,University of Michigan,UW Dearborn Comments: The Themes of Change,Remarks,Campus CT,"Dearborn Comments The Themes of Change Yet I have also sensed an ever-accelerating pace of change in our society, in our state, in our nation, in our world as it approaches the final decade of the 20th Century. Over the past year I have stressed three themes of the future...three themes of change: i) the growing pluralism of our society as our minorities become our majority population as new waves of immigrants arrive on our shores, bringing with them unbounded energy, talent, and faith in the American dream as women ascend to their rightful role as leaders of our society. ii) our evolution into a world nation, ever more tightly coupled to the global community iii) and our rapid transition to a post-industrial knowledge-based society as we enter a new age, an age of knowledge, in which the key strategic resource has become knowledge itself-- that is, educated people and their ideas. But, of course, the themes of pluralism, globalization, and knowlege are not themes of tomorrow... ...these are already themes of today... ...and they are increasingly dominating every aspect of American life. And in this increasingly pluralistic, knowledge-intensive world nation that is America today it seems clear that education in general... ...higher education in particular... ...and the research university most specifically are rapidly becoming the key ingredients determining the strength, prosperity, and social-well being of our nation. The Fundamental Goal: Leadership Just think of the challenges which cry out for our attention • the plight of our cities, the development of an underclass the polarization of American society • greenhouse effect and global change • international competition Pacific Rim or Europe 1992 • health care: cancer, heart disease, AIDS • new frontiers: outer space or spaceship Earth But the greatest need of all is for leadership and this is the University of Michigan’s great contribution to America... ...through its teaching, research, and service ...through its graduates and their achievements Indeed, leadership is both our heritage and our destiny! Of course, we continually strive for leadership... ...in our teaching, our research, our service ...in the classroom, the laboratory, the concert hall...and even on the football field... But I believe we have an even more extraordinary opportunity for leadership... The winds of change are blowing... and they will bring changes in higher education. It seems increasingly apparent that our present concept of the research university developed largely to serve a homogeneous, domestic, industrial society of the 20th Century, must also evolve rapidly if we are to serve... indeed, even be relevant...to the highly heterogeneous, knowledge-intensive, world nation that will be America of the 21st Century. Who will determine the new paradigm for the research? university in America? Who will provide the leadership? Why not the University of Michigan? After all, in a very real sense, it was our University that developed the paradigm of the public university capable of responding to the needs of a rapidly changing America of the 19th century... as American expanded to the frontier... as it evolved through the industrial revolution... as it absorbed wave after wave of immigrants a paradigm that still dominates higher education today. In a sense, we have been throughout our history the flagship of public higher education in America. In a very real sense, it was the University of Michigan which invented the University of the 20th Century. Perhaps it is time that we once again played that role... re-inventing the nature of the university once again... ...a university capable of educating the citizens and serving the society of not the 20th, but rather the 21st Century. I believe we must seize this opportunity as we enter the 1990s to determine our own direction in the light of our tradition, our strength, and our values. The alternative is to passively react to change and to be shaped by the forces around us. But here we face some major challenges: Generally, any discussion of the challenges before higher education is peppered with an assortment of ""isms""...elitism, professionalism, racism... These don’t seem to me to be especially helpful. In fact, I am dismayed by the labeling and posturing that dominates our recent discourse at a time when we most need clarity, reason, and tolerance. I prefer to classify the critical challenges which lie before higher education into several different and more useful catagories i) the costs of excellence ii) our relationship with a myriad of constituencies iii) what might be termed the “corporate culture” of the University iv) and those forces of darkness that surround the University...namely politics! Facing Up to the Constraints 1. The Costs of Excellence My predecessor, Harold Shapiro, used to propose two theorems about the costs of higher education: HTS Theorem 1: There has never been enough money to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of a truly enterprising faculty or administration. HTS Theorem 2: The cost of quality in teaching and research will rise faster than the total resource base of most institutions We face the challenge of making the transition from the growth era of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, characterized by increasing populations, resources, and prestige, to a limited-growth era of the 1980s and beyond. We know all too well the impact of demographics... The decline in the number of high school graduates... The aging of our faculty...and the challenge with educating and recruiting the next generation of the scholars and teachers. The effort and ability of more and more institutions to compete for the same pool of resources... State and federal support Private support Students Faculty Suspicion: The Big Shakeout... The absence of adequate resources to build and sustain excellence in all institutions, means there will be an inevitable shakeout... Most institutions may tend toward the mean-- a common level of quality... However, those few institutions which have the critical mass of excellence...and which have the determination and capacity to sustain it, will be able to draw the best from the available resources of students, faculty, and funds and accelerate away from the pack... leaving the remainder of higher education to compete for a declining resource base. Further, since these institutions will be competing in the same marketplace...for the best students, the best faculty, the same research contracts from Washington , the same grants from foundations and corporations...they will become increasingly similar, Indeed, the distinctions between public and private education will blur even further. Indeed there are already clear signs of this evolutionary trend...and they are clear in our own institution. A Case Study: Brave, New World Last month our Regents approved our budget for the year ahead. In that budget, State appropriation = $267 M Tuition and fees = $269 M (a “privately supported public university”) Federal R&D Support = $256 M (a “federally supported state university”) And now if only our Development staff can increase private fund-raising to a similar share of the total...roughly $250 M per year, we should be in pretty good shape... While this ""well-balanced"" portfolio has certain advantages, such as resilence in the face of political and economic viscissitudes, it also increases dramatically the importance of our ability to interact effectively with a remarkably broad array of constituencies...and this, in itself, is a very major challenge... DEVH Theorem: Over a sufficiently long time span, none of our constraints are rigid. They can be managed or changed. And I can assure you, this is exactly the approach we are taking... 2. Relationship with Constituencies The relationship between the modern university and its many constituencies is a bit like the parable of the elephant and the blind men... People percieve us in vastly different ways, depending on their vantage point, their needs, and their expectations... Students and parents are concerned both with the quality and the cost of education Business and industry seek high quality products...graduates, research, and service Patients of our hospitals seek quality and compassionate care Federal, state, and local government have complex and varied agendas which can both sustain and constrain us... And the public itself sometimes seems to have a love-hate relationship with higher education... they take pride in our quality, revel in our athletic accomplishments, but they also harbor deep suspicions about our costs, our integrity, and, even our intellectual aspirations and commitments. As we become every more dependent on a broad range of constituencies, we will face increasing pressures to establish our relevance and credibility to this array of interests while at the same time sustaining our fundamental values and purposes... Quite a feat!!! Yet balancing act poses several serious problems: i) The diversity--indeed, incompatibility--of the values, needs, and expectations of these various constituencies who all view higher education through quite different lenses (Blind men feeling an elephant...) ii) The increasing narrowness of the public's support for higher education...""What have you done for me lately?"" iii) The tension between such responsiveness and the university's role as center of learning where all ideas can be freely questioned in the light of reason. 3. Corporate Culture Constants of the Motion Of course, there are some fundamental aspects of the character of this University that we must preserve at all costs...physicists would refer to these as “constants of the motion” Our fundamental commitment to excellence in our teaching and scholarship Our respect for and defense of fundamental academic values Academic freedom Freedom of expression Disciplined reason Academic integrity Then, too, there are some uniquely Michigan traditions The liberal spirit and activism of this University Our unique blend of quality, breadth, and capacity... we thrive on a rich diversity of truly outstanding programs Our openess and candor Changes: But I am sure we can all point to other aspects of our University culture that could stand improvement. My personal list includes the following... More of a sense of comunity While many of our achievements occur through the efforts of individuals, Our strength as an institution arises from our ability to join together as a true academic community, in which the human mind is brought boldly to bear on the most enduring questions that confront us. We simply must look for experiences designed to bring people together...to establish new bonds of mutual trust and understanding. More respect for pluralism and diversity While an increasing number on this campus understand the importance of diversity to our future, It is also clear that we need to work and talk together in the months ahead to more clearly define our goals and values. These are not easy matters we are dealing with. We simply must find ways to engage in a open and honest discourse about the meaning of diversity for this University...and to American society... and relate it to our everyday lives as faculty, students, and staff. More of a “customer focus” We must never forget that the primary endeavor of a university is learning... and that our principal customers are our students. It seems clear that we need to re-evaluate and intensify our commitment to the learning process on this campus... ...the way we teach... ...our total environment for learning ...the nurturing relationship that must characterize interactions between faculty and students ...and between staff and students More daring and venturesomeness New ideas and concepts are exploding forth at ever increasing rates in so many disciplines. The capacity for intellectual change and renewal has become increasingly important for the continued vitality of academic institutions. To this end, we must seek a culture in which creativity, initiative, and innovation are valued. We must stimulate more of a risk-taking intellectual culture in which people are encouraged to take bold initiatives. In a sense, we must achieve more of a fault-tolerant culture, in which failure is not punished, but rather is viewed as a natural part of the learning process associated with aiming high! More of a long term, strategic focus All too often the University has tended to respond to external pressures and opportunities, rather than taking strong actions to determine and pursue its own objectives. We must also counter the tendency to become preoccupied with process rather than objectives... with how rather than what... In this sense, we must think and act more strategically--to decide first what we want to do...what we intend to become... and then to move purposefully toward these objectives. More pride in our University An unhappy legacy of the 1960s is a tendency distrust and denigrate institutions-- including universities... ...and including our own University of Michigan. This negativism may still be fashionable in some circles, but not in any I value. Of course the University has flaws and can improve. But we have much to be thankful for, much in which to take pride, much to look forward to, and every reason for confidence in ourselves, each other, and this great institution. 4. Political Issues External Politics: Threats to autonomy by both state and federal government Recent efforts by state government to control Tuition control Largely to protect the Golden Calf -- MET Nonresident tuition levels Admission standards Contact hours Use of teaching assistants Even curriculum, to some degree Federal Government Academic misconduct Content of research and art Loan defaults Tuition and financial aid (“price fixing”) UBIT Restrictions on publications Even intercollegiate athletics Erosion in public confidence in higher education (“Profscam”) Spiraling costs of education Scandals in intercollegiate athletic Academic misconduct Balance between research and teaching Elitism, racism, sexism, radicalism, conservatism...indeed, populism! Unwillingness to invest in the future Our approach to education...like to so much else in life these days...can be summarized by that T-shirt slogan: ""Eat dessert first, life is uncertain"" We have become consumers of education, not investors in the future. We see ourselves caring about the future, but we are not preparing for it. ...the “me generation” of the 1960s has grown up into comfortable Yuppiehood... Internal Politics: The politics of pluralism It is clear that as we move closer to our goal of reflecting the increasing diversity of the American population among our students, faculty, and staff We run the risk of increasing pressures of separatism and distrust that can arise when people of vastly different backgrounds and cultures come together for the first time to live and work together. Fragmentation and the rise of special interest groups in the “multiversity” ...just as they have tended in recent years to dominate American politics The Year Ahead Shifting Focus Team is in place for internal issues Real challenge is relationship with UM to outside State Relations Federal Relations Public Relations Development External Challenges Not all University problems come from the Administration We do contribute our full share, I know, but clearly the world beyond our campus is more challenging, complex, and problematic than ever before. State Relations Signs of Difficulty... Challenges: Erosion in State support Capital Outlay freeze Dangers to quality of higher education posed by MET Assaults on institutional autonomy Nonresident enrollments Tuition control Curriculum (mandatory courses on racism) Bureaucracy Hostile rhetoric... Higher education is costly, inefficient, duplicative Relations with State are not as strong as they need to be changed environment--more fragmented, complex, competitive, and we have not adapted as quckly as needed In many ways, we have continued to apply an approach more suited for the 1950s and 1960s to the 1990s... It is clear that major changes are necessary to renew our compact with the people and leaders of Michigan. Actions: i) Expand Lansing team ii) Building and strengthening Presidents’ Council iii) Alumni efforts (Michigan Advancement Council) iv) Community Relations v) Media Relations Federal Relations Observations: Thanks to quality of work and entrepreneurial zeal, faculty have been brillaintly successful in securing increased federal research support 24% last year. Indeed, this year we will receive more federal support that we do state support We believe that we must become more aggressive in the support of our Washington activities Actions: i) Congressional Delegation ii) National Education Organizations (AAU, NASULGC, ACE) Note: AAU presidents on campus in three weeks!!! iii) UM Federal Relations Structure iv) Activation of Alumni v) Washington Office vi) Washington Campus Public Relations We have to do a better job of communicating and representing our interests to the public. For that reason have strengthened our communications program. Not to project “images” or manipulate opinion but to help each us tell our story effectively and truthfully. Actions: Reassignment of reporting line to President Walt Harrison Communications Advisory Committee Building strong relations with local media Development Writing on the wall: Private support...whether through ...annual giving ...income on endowment Of course, we do quite well for a public university ...$72 M/y ...$450 M endowment ==> $25 M/y But we must do better: By 2000 ...$150 M/y ...$2 B endowment ==> $100 M/y (Note that this would mean that State = federal = tuition = private... ...a remarkably well-balanced portfolio) Investment Policies Themes Diversity and Pluralism, Unity and Community UM has made a very deep commitment to the achievement of an environment which seeks, nourishes, and sustains racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity. To learn how to resist the great pressures of separatism, fear, and bigotry which push us apart... ...and instead commit themselves to a university... ...indeed, to a nation, committed to working together, to achieve common purposes. Michigan is first and foremost a “UNI” versity. Hence we view our challenge as learning how to weave together these dual objectives of diversity and unity in a way that strengthens our fundamental goal of academic excellence and serves our mission and our society. We must not abandon our quest for community and our alliegance to our academic and civic values. I do not believe the goals of diversity and and community are incompatible any more than excellence and diversity are incompatible. But we will need to work hard together to find our way. Pride The University of Michigan is a very special place This campus represents the investment... the sweat and tears... of over 8 generations of Michigan citizens. Each of us, as students, faculty, or staff benefits greatly from this heritage of excellence and commitment. Each of us has a responsibility, both as members and as stewards of this remarkable institution, to do our part not simply to preserve it, but to enhance it for future generations. Whether this is through our efforts to i) maintain and enhance the quality of our academic programs ii) or the care we take of the campus environment iii) or in our efforts to improve the University when necessary iii) or even to defend the University against those who would wrongly undermine it. We are all part of the Michigan family... and like all families, this is a lifelong tie that binds us together. Humility and Humor... There is yet another character of this University that I have always found most refreshing It is our informality, our candor, our willingness to approach our efforts with not only a sense of humility... ...but, more often than not, with sense of humor! Of course, sometimes that is hard to do... ...E.g., when we read about public officials trashing the University for political gain ...or as we watch the final seconds tick off the clock in the driving rain in our loss earlier this month to Notre Dame ...or when we read the Opinion Page of the Michigan Daily Sometimes it takes great patience and a very thick skin...but in the end, “lightening up a bit” is one of the most constructive things we can do. Excitement, optimism This past week we hosted on this campus a distinguished group of alumni and friends in the University Seminar series, in which faculty and staff attempt to convey some of the rich intellectual diversity and excitement of this campus. In talking with this group afterwards, they remarked again and again about the extraordinary vitality and excitement on this campus today... ...the sense of great energy, enthusiasm, and purpose. And, of all the experiences of this, my first year, this Go-Blue Michigan spirit is the thing that stands out foremost in my mind. It is our great strength. Specific Dearborn Challenges 1) Important to recognize that you are in control of your own destiny...there is no master plan for the Dearborn campus over here in Ann Arbor... rather it lies with the faculty, staff, students, and leadership of the Dearborn campus. 2) Different from UM-Flint... ...it has a clear mission with respect to Flint ...you serve greater Detroit area...and, in fact, the state 3) Also greater challenge ...must identify your “market niche” 4) Some strengths ...quality of students ...liberal arts focus ...professional schools in high demand areas (business, engineering, education) ...proximity of Ann Arbor campus ...proximity to City of Detroit ...right across the street from Michigan’s strongest company...Ford ...proximity to Metro Airport 5) Some weakness ...as yet, no clear vision of mission ...surrounded by educational institutions ...WSU, EMU, Oakland U ...commuter college ...level of state funding 6) Some strategic questions: ...What do you want to become? ...What do you believe you can become? ...How do you begin to move in this direction? 7) Some tactical questions ...In the face of limited state resources, can UMD really achieve quality with its present enrollments? ...Could it play a role as the UM’s primary interface with the City of Detroit...being much more responsive to students from the City?",https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/118743/jjd1290.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y,James Duderstadt,Male,7/1/88,857,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Looking Inward,1/1/87,12/31/92,Public,Ann Arbor ,MI,Midwest,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",50,"Dearborn Comments The Themes of Change Yet I have also sensed an ever-accelerating pace of change in our society, in our state, in our nation, in our world as it approaches the final decade of the 20th Century. Over the past year I have stressed three themes of the future...three themes of change: i) the growing pluralism of our society as our minorities become our majority population as new waves of immigrants arrive on our shores, bringing with them unbounded energy, talent, and faith in the American dream as women ascend to their rightful role as leaders of our society. ii) our evolution into a world nation, ever more tightly coupled to the global community iii) and our rapid transition to a post-industrial knowledge-based society as we enter a new age, an age of knowledge, in which the key strategic resource has become knowledge itself-- that is, educated people and their ideas. But, of course, the themes of pluralism, globalization, and knowlege are not themes of tomorrow... ...these are already themes of today... ...and they are increasingly dominating every aspect of American life. And in this increasingly pluralistic, knowledge-intensive world nation that is America today it seems clear that education in general... ...higher education in particular... ...and the research university most specifically are rapidly becoming the key ingredients determining the strength, prosperity, and social-well being of our nation. The Fundamental Goal: Leadership Just think of the challenges which cry out for our attention • the plight of our cities, the development of an underclass the polarization of American society • greenhouse effect and global change • international competition Pacific Rim or Europe 1992 • health care: cancer, heart disease, AIDS • new frontiers: outer space or spaceship Earth But the greatest need of all is for leadership and this is the University of Michigan’s great contribution to America... ...through its teaching, research, and service ...through its graduates and their achievements Indeed, leadership is both our heritage and our destiny! Of course, we continually strive for leadership... ...in our teaching, our research, our service ...in the classroom, the laboratory, the concert hall...and even on the football field... But I believe we have an even more extraordinary opportunity for leadership... The winds of change are blowing... and they will bring changes in higher education. It seems increasingly apparent that our present concept of the research university developed largely to serve a homogeneous, domestic, industrial society of the 20th Century, must also evolve rapidly if we are to serve... indeed, even be relevant...to the highly heterogeneous, knowledge-intensive, world nation that will be America of the 21st Century. Who will determine the new paradigm for the research? university in America? Who will provide the leadership? Why not the University of Michigan? After all, in a very real sense, it was our University that developed the paradigm of the public university capable of responding to the needs of a rapidly changing America of the 19th century... as American expanded to the frontier... as it evolved through the industrial revolution... as it absorbed wave after wave of immigrants a paradigm that still dominates higher education today. In a sense, we have been throughout our history the flagship of public higher education in America. In a very real sense, it was the University of Michigan which invented the University of the 20th Century. Perhaps it is time that we once again played that role... re-inventing the nature of the university once again... ...a university capable of educating the citizens and serving the society of not the 20th, but rather the 21st Century. I believe we must seize this opportunity as we enter the 1990s to determine our own direction in the light of our tradition, our strength, and our values. The alternative is to passively react to change and to be shaped by the forces around us. But here we face some major challenges: Generally, any discussion of the challenges before higher education is peppered with an assortment of ""isms""...elitism, professionalism, racism... These don’t seem to me to be especially helpful. In fact, I am dismayed by the labeling and posturing that dominates our recent discourse at a time when we most need clarity, reason, and tolerance. I prefer to classify the critical challenges which lie before higher education into several different and more useful catagories i) the costs of excellence ii) our relationship with a myriad of constituencies iii) what might be termed the “corporate culture” of the University iv) and those forces of darkness that surround the University...namely politics! Facing Up to the Constraints 1. The Costs of Excellence My predecessor, Harold Shapiro, used to propose two theorems about the costs of higher education: HTS Theorem 1: There has never been enough money to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of a truly enterprising faculty or administration. HTS Theorem 2: The cost of quality in teaching and research will rise faster than the total resource base of most institutions We face the challenge of making the transition from the growth era of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, characterized by increasing populations, resources, and prestige, to a limited-growth era of the 1980s and beyond. We know all too well the impact of demographics... The decline in the number of high school graduates... The aging of our faculty...and the challenge with educating and recruiting the next generation of the scholars and teachers. The effort and ability of more and more institutions to compete for the same pool of resources... State and federal support Private support Students Faculty Suspicion: The Big Shakeout... The absence of adequate resources to build and sustain excellence in all institutions, means there will be an inevitable shakeout... Most institutions may tend toward the mean-- a common level of quality... However, those few institutions which have the critical mass of excellence...and which have the determination and capacity to sustain it, will be able to draw the best from the available resources of students, faculty, and funds and accelerate away from the pack... leaving the remainder of higher education to compete for a declining resource base. Further, since these institutions will be competing in the same marketplace...for the best students, the best faculty, the same research contracts from Washington , the same grants from foundations and corporations...they will become increasingly similar, Indeed, the distinctions between public and private education will blur even further. Indeed there are already clear signs of this evolutionary trend...and they are clear in our own institution. A Case Study: Brave, New World Last month our Regents approved our budget for the year ahead. In that budget, State appropriation = $267 M Tuition and fees = $269 M (a “privately supported public university”) Federal R&D Support = $256 M (a “federally supported state university”) And now if only our Development staff can increase private fund-raising to a similar share of the total...roughly $250 M per year, we should be in pretty good shape... While this ""well-balanced"" portfolio has certain advantages, such as resilence in the face of political and economic viscissitudes, it also increases dramatically the importance of our ability to interact effectively with a remarkably broad array of constituencies...and this, in itself, is a very major challenge... DEVH Theorem: Over a sufficiently long time span, none of our constraints are rigid. They can be managed or changed. And I can assure you, this is exactly the approach we are taking... 2. Relationship with Constituencies The relationship between the modern university and its many constituencies is a bit like the parable of the elephant and the blind men... People percieve us in vastly different ways, depending on their vantage point, their needs, and their expectations... Students and parents are concerned both with the quality and the cost of education Business and industry seek high quality products...graduates, research, and service Patients of our hospitals seek quality and compassionate care Federal, state, and local government have complex and varied agendas which can both sustain and constrain us... And the public itself sometimes seems to have a love-hate relationship with higher education... they take pride in our quality, revel in our athletic accomplishments, but they also harbor deep suspicions about our costs, our integrity, and, even our intellectual aspirations and commitments. As we become every more dependent on a broad range of constituencies, we will face increasing pressures to establish our relevance and credibility to this array of interests while at the same time sustaining our fundamental values and purposes... Quite a feat!!! Yet balancing act poses several serious problems: i) The diversity--indeed, incompatibility--of the values, needs, and expectations of these various constituencies who all view higher education through quite different lenses (Blind men feeling an elephant...) ii) The increasing narrowness of the public's support for higher education...""What have you done for me lately?"" iii) The tension between such responsiveness and the university's role as center of learning where all ideas can be freely questioned in the light of reason. 3. Corporate Culture Constants of the Motion Of course, there are some fundamental aspects of the character of this University that we must preserve at all costs...physicists would refer to these as “constants of the motion” Our fundamental commitment to excellence in our teaching and scholarship Our respect for and defense of fundamental academic values Academic freedom Freedom of expression Disciplined reason Academic integrity Then, too, there are some uniquely Michigan traditions The liberal spirit and activism of this University Our unique blend of quality, breadth, and capacity... we thrive on a rich diversity of truly outstanding programs Our openess and candor Changes: But I am sure we can all point to other aspects of our University culture that could stand improvement. My personal list includes the following... More of a sense of comunity While many of our achievements occur through the efforts of individuals, Our strength as an institution arises from our ability to join together as a true academic community, in which the human mind is brought boldly to bear on the most enduring questions that confront us. We simply must look for experiences designed to bring people together...to establish new bonds of mutual trust and understanding. More respect for pluralism and diversity While an increasing number on this campus understand the importance of diversity to our future, It is also clear that we need to work and talk together in the months ahead to more clearly define our goals and values. These are not easy matters we are dealing with. We simply must find ways to engage in a open and honest discourse about the meaning of diversity for this University...and to American society... and relate it to our everyday lives as faculty, students, and staff. More of a “customer focus” We must never forget that the primary endeavor of a university is learning... and that our principal customers are our students. It seems clear that we need to re-evaluate and intensify our commitment to the learning process on this campus... ...the way we teach... ...our total environment for learning ...the nurturing relationship that must characterize interactions between faculty and students ...and between staff and students More daring and venturesomeness New ideas and concepts are exploding forth at ever increasing rates in so many disciplines. The capacity for intellectual change and renewal has become increasingly important for the continued vitality of academic institutions. To this end, we must seek a culture in which creativity, initiative, and innovation are valued. We must stimulate more of a risk-taking intellectual culture in which people are encouraged to take bold initiatives. In a sense, we must achieve more of a fault-tolerant culture, in which failure is not punished, but rather is viewed as a natural part of the learning process associated with aiming high! More of a long term, strategic focus All too often the University has tended to respond to external pressures and opportunities, rather than taking strong actions to determine and pursue its own objectives. We must also counter the tendency to become preoccupied with process rather than objectives... with how rather than what... In this sense, we must think and act more strategically--to decide first what we want to do...what we intend to become... and then to move purposefully toward these objectives. More pride in our University An unhappy legacy of the 1960s is a tendency distrust and denigrate institutions-- including universities... ...and including our own University of Michigan. This negativism may still be fashionable in some circles, but not in any I value. Of course the University has flaws and can improve. But we have much to be thankful for, much in which to take pride, much to look forward to, and every reason for confidence in ourselves, each other, and this great institution. 4.

What a contrast today, when the university finds itself considered a key social economic, political, social and cultural institution. And we are rapidly evolving into a new post-industrial society, in which the key strategic resource necessary for prosperity and social well-being has become knowledge itself. In all advanced societies, our future depends to an ever increasing extent on new discoveries, expert knowlege, and highly trained people. Like it or not, universities are our principal source of all three ingredients. (Bok) “The solution of virtually all the problems with which government is concerned: health, education, environment, energy, urban development, international relationships, space, economic competitiveness, and defense and national security, all depend on creating new knowledge---and hence upon the health of America’s research universities” (Bloch) But, ironically enough, our increasingly critical role has not brought with it increased prestige, public confidence or respect. Instead, like so many other institutions in our society we are roundly criticized by right, left and center and from even from within by many faculty, students and staff for flaws large and small, fundamental and trivial. The American research university is clearly under attack... ...attacked by parents and students for uncontrolled escalation of tuition ...they are critized by governors for financial irresponsibility ...investigated by the Department of Justice for collusion in tuition and financial aid fixing ...critized by both Washington and their own faculties for rising indirect costs ...attacked by Congress for alleged conflcits of interest or providing easy access of foreign firms to government-supported research ...attacked by legislatures for the tenure system, ...and attack by the left and the right for the quality of undergraduate education Particular Concern: Teaching vs. Research Next to college curriculum, no aspect of university education has provoked more complaints that the faculty’s preoccupation with research at the expense of teaching. It is widely believed that institutions slight their students when they emphasize research in making appointments and refuse to promote unproductive professors even though they are highly successful classroom teachers. Critics condemn the bulk of scholarly activity either as a serile product of requirements imposed by philistine administrators or as a form of private pleasure that selfish professions enjoy at the expense of their students. The Changing Nature of Higher Education These radical changes in the very nature of the university were driven by economic, social, political and technological forces in part generated within the academy and, at the same time, transforming it. Of course this was made much easier by unprecedented growth and prosperity during the past half century In the postWorld War II years we have become a central institution of our society with new roles and responsibilities for everything from economic development to national security, ...community development to remedial education, ...health care to the exploration of space, ...the preservation of our culture to triggering of social change. For intellectuals, historically consigned to the sidelines during America’s formative years, it has been a heady experience to find oursleves admired, flattered, needed and, best of all, funded at levels undreamt of only a little over a generation ago. For much of their history, America’s universities were protected enclaves respected well enough but mostly unnoticed and allowed . to go about our business unchallenged and largely unfettered. What a contrast today, when we find ourselves considered a key social economic, political, social and cultural institution. But, ironically enough, our increasingly critical role has not brought with it increased prestige, public confidence or respect. Instead, like so many other institutions we are roundly criticized by right, left and center and from even from within by many faculty, students and staff for flaws large and small, fundamental and trivial. The titles of the books by some of our critics reveal this: ...”The Moral Collapse of the University” ...”Tenured Radicals” ...”Killing the Spirit” ...”Profscam” ...and, yes, Virginia, “The Closing of the American Mind” It might be easy to answer and dismiss these critics one by one with logic, or a righteous dismissal of any who would question our purposes and privileges. And of course, there there is much that is refutable in the recent spate of books and articles from he right and the left that question our performance and even reject the very foundation of what we do. But I believe it is a mistake to simply dismiss our critics. Rather we should pay attention to what they say, since what they all appear to have in common is a question of our commitment to fundamental academic values. Besides, the truth is that we can no longer ignore them even if we wanted to. They will not go away. To the extent their criticism is constructive, we should try to hear it. To the extent they are wrong, we should try to answer them with a compelling affirmation, a reneal of our vision and purposes, a confirmation of our unique community rights and responsibilities arrived at through extensive debate and discussion among ourselves and with our many constituents. Academic Values and Traditions The Key Issue? Issue is less to respond to critics than to understand underlying issues affecting academic values and relations to scoeity. Critics threaten to undermine us just when we are most needed. Key issue is to understand and renew concept of academic freedom within context of our own times. What exactly are our special freedoms and responsibilities as academics? Cloistered Beginnings For centuries, academic institutions have been sheltered from very much public attention or criticism Many traditions and values have medieval/ religious origins Pursuit of learning for its own sake in many traditions is priestly function or at least sacred and set aside from ordinary affairs and object of respect and support. We in universities have always kept about us this aura of the “sacred” that has been accepted and respected by society/.....at least when it thought about us at all which frankly wasn’t all that often. Sacred aura derives from unfettered pursuit of truth which is seen by society as something above and apart from the concerns of ordinary life but inherently valuable. Acceptance by Society In fact, universities must be doing something right to be so durable and today arguably one of the few --or only-- truly universal human social institution. Today, academia has proved to be one of the most durable and pervasive human institutions spanning nearly eight centuries and found around the globe. What explains the power of the institutional model that has sustained support of the public in so many parts of the world for what we do? If we understand the source of our strength, perhaps we can see better what might beundermining it today. Ashby -- Universities are universally accepted as the best means for social investment in human resources --teaching and research--investment in the future. Society believes in and supports our fundamental mission of teaching and research/entrusts to us its children, its future ...it respects our autonomy when we stick to mission ...itespects our values as institutions and as academics when we stick to mission and values Values are the glue that bind us together and account for our successful adaptation throughout the centuries Considering the differences among us and the disputatious nature of what we do, if we didn’t collectively subscribe to certain fundamental principles and values, we could not long survive. And this is what troubles me as I speak to you today. Are universities, is our university, succumbing to breakdown of consensus that afflicts society at large. This wouldn’t be surprising for we are not fully apart from society but it is cause for us to stop and reflect and to try to reclaim /sustain what is most valuable in our heritage and most essential to our future. We owe this to ourselves and our students and the public that supports us and we owe it to those who come after us. External Pressures Over the centuries, there have been continuing threats to academic freedom from many external religious, political, and other sources. In America, there have been regular assaults on academic freedom largely coming from external zealots who would impose a particular belief or orthodoxy on scholarship and teaching --they a re still very much at work and a threat to our institutions and schools Recently we were reminded of the external threat to the academy represented by McCarthyism. SACUA is to be commended for its concern to recall the excess and wrongs of that disgraceful era in national life. (In principle it is laudable, too, that you were concerned to right wrongs of that time although I myself have a grave concern about the implication that it is possible to judge the complexities of events ex post facto without some sort of due process that would attempt to arrive at a reasoned and fair judgment. Problem is that as institutions we are not well equipped to serve as courts of law or arbiters of political issues.) In Soviet Union, there was the imposition of ideology on science --Lysenko which set science and the Soviet academy back and discredited institutions. In other regions, faculty and students have been killed, universities closed, libraries burned. Threats to academic freedom/free inquiry are alive and well in our world today. Free inquiry cannot be tolerated by tyrants or mobs. Use examples within political context: State legislature, governor Federal government Many other examples of attempts to impose orthodoxies on academy by political and religious authorities. But by and large over the longer term these have failed because of resisting strength and courage of scholars and eventual understanding of societies that if they want to educate their young to be civilized citizens of the world and want to advance learning as part of the world civilization, they must grant freedoms to scholars and their institutions. No cause for complacency. It is a delicate balance and like all liberties, it requires eternal vigilance to maintain. We must not abuse academic freedoms or take them for granted/the price is not just the loss of our particular institutional freedoms and values but erosion of one of humanities finest institutional achievements. We in universities are privileged but with our privileges come important responsibilities. Therefore we must constantly be alert to threats from the right, left, and center...from outside our walls...but also from within. Internal Pressures Conformity Bollinger “Common to think of threats to academic freedom as something that needs to be protected from (external) official interference or sanctions.” ....On the other hand, academic freedom can be inhibited by very subtle interventions, by the atmosphere in which people work, think and teach.” Conformity: “Little actions here and there, insignificant in themselves, may together add up to a feeling that the better court is to conform, to avoid risks in research and teaching.” In this connection, we must be aware of presures to conformity in admissions, hiring, advancement...and conformity in ideas including disciplinary conformity. Conformity can be fostered by the need to please other external masters--civic, commercial, media But conformity can also be internally generated by erosion of common values of free inquiry, civility due to zealotry from within. Politicization The safeguard for adademic freedom has been the principle that academics would conduct their teaching and researchideally free of bias. (We may not achieve this standard, but it is one we agree to strive for.) Once scholarship is politicized...once it becomes a partisan issue, an arena for political activism, we have undermined a principle argument for academic freedom. Other forces can threaten the academy, they are internal academic freedoms came in the late 60’s and early 70’s. Students and faculty, frustrated at inability to affect national foreign or domestic policy through traditional political activity, abandoned it and turned inward, instead, to universities to make them an arena of intense political conflict. I n pursuit of good ideals, all aspects of the the academy are seen to be fair political targets for revolutionary change. No area of university life was left untouched. The University, because of its visibility, its importance, and its vulnerability has become the battleground for political debate... ...in the '60s, VietNam ...in the '70s, the environment ...in the '80s, racial justice ...and today, in the '90s, ""political correctness"" The debate about some important questions of human rights and justice and other critical issues was important and positive but the methods employed have left permanent scars and deep confusion about the relation of ends and means. (Some seem to imagine that the test of an idea is not its merit but the sincerity of the holder) Some in universities came to accept the truly pernicious idea that a just end, justified the antidemocratic means used to achieve it. This is particularly true of students...who can easily be mislead by those with other agendas. But obviously still feeling effects. Missions and Roles The modern university may simply be attempting to serve too many masters. Temptation: To the extent that academia is overextended and external engagement is at expense of educational and research mission we have a crisis of values that feeds a deeper public unease, rejection or mistrust concerning values and direction of American higher education. Political Correctness Introductions Current assult on the academy and its values is two-fold from those who would undermine and exploit academic institutions, freedoms, and values for their own ends. The “Anti-PC-ers” First, I think it is vitally important that we hear our critics. Their ideas as any others should be freely and rigorously examined. Granted, a good many of them are extremists, polemicists, and have own political and opportunistic agenda. Much of what is being written is incredibly superficial, factually incorrect, and wildly over-stated Review selected critics and quotes by PC critics here A lot of this is pure opportunism and ideological guerrilla warfare. Just another chapter in the contemporary media debasement of public institutions and discussion of important issues through hype, sound bite simplification, pandering to fads and to basest prejudices. Always on the lookout for a new lightening rod for public dissatisfaction/frustration. This time around we are it. Part of this anti-pc agenda is old fashioned reactionary. Through polemic try to stop greater inclusiveness of people and ideas and to hold on to status quo. The critical thing is not to respond according to their rules, not to be distracted from basic debates. Nonetheless, we would be in grave danger if we don’t heed a basic message: What these critics are saying is striking a deep vein of public discontent with academia. Also demonstrates a growing and worrisome gulf between intellectuals/opinion makers and academics. We have to few allies to alienate important opinion-makers. We also cannot ignore the fact that there are also a growing number of concerned faculty, students, administrators and other educators and leaders who are concerned that we are losing touch with ourselves and our mission. They are echoing the famous philosopher Pogo who said: “We have seen the enemy and he is us.” Real issue is values. The public is disillusioned, believes we have lost touch with our mission and values. This is the ground on which we should stand. If we want to counter critics, it is on values that we must stand. Promoting Status Quo: At the same time, must also note that some anti-pcer’s oppose any and or all adaptation to diversity and throw up a smoke screen of polemic to disguise their true aims which are often to protect the status quo. The PC Agenda Really encompasses many things and views Extremists/right, left and center have always been with us but never so aggressive and hostile as now. What is different now? The painful truth is that critics of the politically correct don’t lack examples of destructive, even ludicrous, extremism/zealotry on campuses, indeed on our own campus. These don’t at all represent the majority. Actually only a small part of community. •Attempts to impose orthodoxy/ prevent or undermine true debate •Use of Correct Language •Sensitivity Training--attempts to teach people not to engage in racism, sexism, etc--but can be seen also as attempt to impose orthodoxy Perhaps we need to focus more on actual behavior not thoughts/absence of a code is impediment to this •Required courses on diversity Need to distinguish between attempts to promote political orthodoxy and legitimate need to educate about other peoples and cultures, nature of prejudice and its role in social and economic relations, etc. Had disciplines been more open to new ideas, this would be a regular part of ongoing campus dialog and not politicized. •Intimidation of professors who “teach wrong” or research “wrong” Note case of professor whose research proposal was illegally taken from his desk by students who disagreed with his premise in effort to undermine chances with sponsor. Note Farley Labeling of people and personalizing debate •Censorship of campus speakers or groups and individuals either by not inviting controversial speakers at all, by shouting down those with whom they disagree example: Chief Justice at Law School Attempts to achieve ends by intimidation and bullying Regent’s meetings In other words, free speech for me but not for you! Disrespectful and destructive behavior that personalizes debate through attacks on individuals Attempts to impose orthodoxy in hiring/professional advancement •Propagandizing--in classroom abusing privileges of academic freedom or in research Propagandizing/failure to honor ideal of fair hearing for all sides of issue--attempts to indoctrinate or propagandize students in the classroom. For example, I was deeply disturbed to learn that students were shown only one side of the argument about the Gulf War by some teaching assistants and faculty. Whatever our personal views on that event, the classroom is not the place for propaganda for one opinion. This is a violation of students rights and undermines credibility respect for academic profession. It is one thing to express ones own views and label them as such and also to then note opposing views, it is quite another to endorse political positions and open the classroom to outright propaganda Actually, I believe that propagandizing moreoften than not leads to backlash and therefore has an effect oppostive of the one intended. Of course, in the end, I have confidence in our students ability to arrive at their own opinions despite misguided though well intentioned efforts to indoctrinate them. A good example was our Spring Commencement. Propagandizing more often than not leads to backlash and therefore has an effect opposite of the one intended. •Policies/codes/sanctions to define and enforce ban on racially --etc--insensitive speech At Michigan student policy is""interim"" and this is a deliberate stragegy. Faculty sexual harassment policy--difficult matters and potential for abuse, but cannot deny that abuses are occurring and they are damaging to individuals and to social fabric of trust. Need to raise the standard of civility/respect so that such policies are unnecessary. •Politicizing the curriculum and research by right--Alan Bloom and by left, half baked Marxist efforts to denigrate Western tradition in favor of third world studies Critics cite excesses of new fields-- Women’s Studies Black Studies, etc. and some proponents are more polemicists than scholars but must also recognize the very considerable contributions and achievements of these fields which challenge disciplinary orthodoxy, and bring fresh perspectives, challenge established paradigms. This is what academic work is about and we should welcome the fundamental debate it brings. Invigorates as long as we are free to consider merit of ideas. •Affirmative Action policies--preferential treatment of minorities, women in recruitment, admissions, hiring, advancement Critics claim that Affirmative action actually promotes increasing segregation/balkanization/ separate systems of services and policies to serve special interests Also suggestion that academics apply different standards of judgment to grading or consideration of PC ideas. Important to debate the basis for academic judgments. No propositions should be off limits. But leave the propaganda out of it. Intellectual Issues How can scholars deny the importance for creativity, of ides so powerful that they can change the world? Of course, there is value in looking at issues of power in thee academy, and scholars should be free to express their views, their ideologies freely. What is not acceptable is the attempt to impose views/ideologies on the institutional of academic or on others with in it through intimidation, derision, shouting, disrespect for views and rights of others Other pressures from within that also undermine academic freedom and inquiry Market--conformity from self imposed censorship to please internal or external audiences Intellectual Orthodoxies--conformities imposed by disciplinary orthodoxies or funding agencies or administrative bias that subtly or not so subtlety operate against risk taking and unfettered inquiry Characteristics Extremism Personal Attacks Peter Steiner Reynolds Farley Ends justify means Rights without responsibilities Exploitation ...of students ...of institution ...of positions Nature of Debate But until recently debate within the academy has been conducted according to time honored scholarly standards and values Now attempts to influence academia are not by argument, not by persuasion, not by quality of ideas Instead, now we see anti-intellectual, anti rational polemic, see a few efforts to impose mob rule. we see intimidation of individuals, of speakers, of scholars and their work topics are declared off limits, so are individuals and their work declared unacceptable intolerance and ad hominem attacks, personalizing of issues, vilification of individuals In short, extremists from within threaten what 800 years of history couldn’t accomplish When extremists are at work, regardless of persuasion, truth and freedom are usually their first victims. The erosion of fundamental values and purposes disrupts the delicate balance necessary for rational consideration, and creates a climate that discourages risktaking within and brings with it the increasinging loss of public confidence and support. And this isn’t the only threat to freedoms. Let me also note that we see cruel racial epithets, sexual exploitation and harassment, narrow minded and cruel bigotry, prejudice and defense of unfair privilege. Puritanism A lot of this is not new just more strident and overtly political. Puritan heritage is apparent in need to separate the saved from the damned--the correct from the incorrect and then to try to silence or exile the incorrect. Half baked interpretations of Marxist theory that reduce all intellectual questions to simplistic expressions of power. Cargo-Cult Science Academic Values and Traditions We have evolved a set of traditions and values that over many centuries have attracted people to universities and command their loyalty and devoted service Educated generations of humanity to value learning as well as to prepare for vocations This has command support from societies of many religious, political and ideological orientations Tried and true methods and standards/ (Use AAUP early statement here) Theodore Roosevelt at Durham, 1905: “You stand for those things for which the scholar must stand if he is to render real and lasting service (to the state). You stand for academic freedom, for the right of private judgment, for the duty more incumbent upon the scholar than upon any other man, to tell the truth as he sees it, to claim for himself and to give to o others the largest liberty in seeking after truth.” (quoted by Terry Sanford in Pullias Lecture) Fundamental principle is the application of reason to human affairs/Pursuit of truth through reason scientific method/experimentation Also methods of non scientific scholarship that call for objective , fair and open assessment of ideas, performance, people Merit is the ideal whether in judging ideas or performance Commitment to openness, to debate, to free inquiry-- only when ideas can be freely explored, can we hope to find truth While not fundamental principle, mutual respect and civility, a willingness to respect and consider views of others, is needed for conduct of teaching and research. We cannot accept those who would shout down a person or idea or who think that opinions should be imposed on others by intimidation, ideas should be judged by the number of their adherents rather in whether they are right. Over centuries we have found that our objective of seeking truth and our means of seeking it have stood the test. We haven’t achieved perfection but we do have a way of considering questions and problems that yields insight and lights the way to new and better questions. Bok quote “our methods give a sense of what is probably right and do identify what is incorrect. What binds us together then is the search for truth, the tested methods, principles and values of scholarship. Society supports these values because universities over the centuries and across the globe have managed to teach succeeding generations a a respect for the pursuit of truth and an ability to take up the quest themselves and because Our methods and principles have succeeded in increasing our store of knowledge and understanding over the centuries We have learned that free inquiry, reason, debate are the best road to truth. Society has accepted this and has respected the value of academic freedom that is the essential prerequisite to learning and teaching. Academic Freedom Academic freedom is the core value that accounts for our value to society. Without it, we cannot freely search for truth in teaching and research. Academic Freedom is not in the constitution and figures in law but not as clearly defined right (Note Bollinger here: “(Academic Freedom) is a value that exists independent of law.”) Academic freedom is supported by Constitutional rights such as those embodied in First Ammednment at least in public universities (don’t apply in private institutions but nonetheless the freedoms have been perhaps better safeguarded in them.) But legal definitions though important are not the bedrock of academic freedom. Academic freedom is too precious to leave to lawyers and politicians. Only we in the academy, only faculty, ultimately can define and defend it. Most significant underlying social value of academic freedom is the time tested proposition that free inquiry is the best road to truth. Academic Freedom more in the nature of a compact between society and academic institutions/a matter of faith and trust/temptingly fragile bond and easily broken by either side. A compact not for short term benefits (and we make a profound mistake if we suggest this as a rationale) such as immediate payoffs e.g., cures for a disease, or economic development, but for longer term gains in knowledge and understanding. The deeper quality of life is benefited by the pursuit of learning. Therefore, threats to academic freedom are threats to our essence, whether internal or external. Key Principles to Apply General Academia facing difficult issues and choices/Polemics obscure real and important issues University is paying for extremists from both pc and anti pc camp. Creating climate in which it is increasingly difficult to discuss and debate openly critical issues before us. PCer’s trivialize and obscure fundamental issues /anti pcer’s take advantage to try to intimidate us from coping with fundamental issues. Both undermine climate and values necessary for rational discussion. Superficial polemics and orthodoxies on all sides, obscures the real issues we ought to be discussing ad debating openly and vigorously among ourselves and with larger society. At bottom, much of the debate reflects a deep and abiding tension between fundamental principles of liberty and justice that both bedeviled and energizes our political system. too important to trivialize. Need disciplined reflection that cannot happen amid all the noise and hoopla. Comment here on rights vs responsibilities...freedom requires acceptance of responsibilities Defense of Values Academia must defend its fundamental values and freedoms: We are engaged in debate about critical issues but it will be useless and even destructive if we cannot agree to adhere to our basic values. If we don’t then we can be sure that there will be many more critics where these came from and it won’t be long before institutional freedom and autonomy is eroded beyond reclamation. Need to debate critical Issues and problems but within the context of our values and traditions What is the value of academic freedom to the faculty. Studies repeatedly show that what faculty value most are autonomy and freedom, intellectual interchange and the opportunity to be with students. These are precious satisfactions and worth preserving at whatever cost. We don’t have to like each other or agree with each other. We just have to agree to some basic rules of the road that have served us for generations. Include Hanna Gray's comments here. We are responsible for handing down to future generations, the freedoms we inherit intact and preferably strneghened. Examples of Application Missions What is our missionin the 21st Century. This should be the central issue before us, not the polemics of extremists. Let us define the terms, the agenda for ourselves. We are faced with critical choices. Transformations of society, economy, population all signal profound shifts that must be reflected in teaching and research. Must deal with some of the most difficult and intractable problems. Debate about curriculum, about new interdisciplinary fields such as ethnic, women, etc, and about aims of diversity and multiculturalism all important and necessary. thus they have been are and always will be the subject of debate and this can be a healthy thing (Hanah Gray :Debate about curriculum is way of criticizing present and inventing the future) We know how to do this in academia. LS&A debate was a wonderful example of how debate is possible Extremists don’t want or accept compromise or complexity but the rest of us must do so. But at the same time let us not forget that racism and sexism and other prejudices are real in our society and we see them at work on our campus every day. Are we offering truly equal opportunity as required by our ideals and aspirations, by law and by social necessity? If not, what do we need to change. Our world has been transformed --population, internationalization, age of knowledge. Are our structures, methods, principles, policies open to necessary evolution to incorporate new perspectives and experiences of many peoples and civilizations into teaching and research. Mandate/ Diversity: Fundamental questions need to be discussed about teaching and research.

The University has made a very deep commitment to the achievement of an environment that seeks, nourishes, and sustains racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity. We must learn how to resist the great pressures of prejudices, separatism, and the fear and bigotry which push us apart. Instead we must pledge ourselves to being a university, indeed, a nation, committed to working together, to achieve great public purposes. Michigan is first and foremost a ""UNI"" versity-not a ""DI"" versity. Hence we view our challenge as learning how to weave together these dual objectives of diversity and unity in a way that strengthens our fundamental goal of academic excellence and serves our academic mission and our society. We must not abandon our quest for community and our allegiance to our academic and civic values. I do not believe the goals of diversity and community are incompatible any more than I believe that excellence and diversity are incompatible. But we will need to work hard together to weave these goals together in new ways that will inspire and strengthen our University. It is important to state here clearly that in drafting the Michigan Mandate, I certainly did not view myself as Moses returning from the mountain with stone tablets of commandments to govern the University. Rather, this document was intended as a very personal statement of my own views and recommendations on these matters. In a sense, I viewed the Michigan Mandate both as a challenge to the University community and as a road map, setting out my personal commitments to an eventual destination for our University. I hope you will approach the plan as part of a dynamic process and not as a finished product.

Hence, in this sense, my challenge to the University, the plan I set before it, has already changed. It will continue to change as more and more people become a part of the process of commenting, criticizing, and suggesting improvements, and-it is my hope-becoming committed to and actively involved in this great challenge to the University and to America.

53,umi5,7/16/91,University of Michigan,1991 Annual Report of the President,Message,Campus CT,"All in all, this has been a quite remarkable year for the University. While a more extensive listing of various activities and events has been provided in my annual activities summary, let me note a few of the highlights. We began the academic year last fall with yet another series of exciting announcement from the genetic medicine research team led by Francis Collins. This group is doing some of the most exciting medical research in the world today (and we are told they are likely to receive the Nobel Prize in the next few years). They have systematically identified the genetic causes of several of our society's most crippling diseases--cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, diabetes, the inability to control cholesterol levels, and most recently focusing their attention on the genetic causes of breast cancer. Yet beyond this, Michigan scientists are attempting to develop gene therapy methods to deal with these tragic diseases. In many ways, the leadership being provided by Michigan's medical scientists today is similar to that it provided 40 years ago when it performed the clinical trials for the Salk vaccine. Further, as Professor Collins pointed out at one of last year's Regents' meetings, since genetic causes are key to many of today's most crippling diseases (heart disease, cancer, AIDs,...), the University is clearly providing leadership of great importance to our society. Last year our students provided similar excitement through the Sunrunner project: the effort to design, build, and race a solar-powered automobile in both national and world competitions. Last summer the Michigan team of 150 students won the national competitionand the right to represent the United States in the world competition in the outback of Western Australia. Competing against over 45 teams from countries throughout the world, Michigan finished third, behind only Swiss and Honda factory teams. It was a proud moment for the University. Michigan scholars continued to win high honors throughout the year. Last fall two Michigan faculty won the MacCarther Prize, Rebecca Scott and Sherry Orner, to be joined this June by Alice Fulton as yet another MacCarther winner. We also had a bumper crop of new members of the learned academies (Science, Engineering, Arts and Letters). And, while we continue to be under 1991 Annual Report --CONFIDENTIAL-- 2 serious raiding pressure, after reviewing this year's promotion case books, I believe that the quality of our faculty has never been higher. Several key facilities projects were completed. Last fall we were joined by an alumnus, United States Surgeon General Antonio Novello, to dedicate the new Child and Maternal Health Care Center. This spring, President Gerald Ford did the honors in dedicating Schembechler Hall. And, of course, this September when Michigan plays Notre Dame, we will break in the ""new"" Michigan Stadium with its lowered field and ""prescription athletic turf"". The University's impact in science and engineering continued at a leadership level. As you know, for the past several years the University, in partnership with IBM and MCI, has managed the principal computer network, the National Research and Education Network, linking together over three million users in universities, industrial and government research laboratories around the world. This effort has now become so successful that last fall UM, IBM, and MCI formed a nonprofit corporation, Advanced Network Services, Inc., to handle the next phase of the network at it evolves into what will eventually become the ""interstate highway system of information exchange"". This past spring ANS, Inc. spun off its first for-profit subsidiary. Incidentally, I would note that the University's efforts have positioned the State of Michigan quite well in the rapidly evolving information technology industry. In a similar vein, it was announced last fall that a team of Michigan engineers and scientists led by Professor Gerard Mourou, had built the world's most powerful laser. In December the National Science Foundation announced that Michigan had been selected as the site of a new $15 million National Science and Engineering Center in the Ultrafast Optics. I should note here that Mourou and his team were attracted to Michigan through the use of the Research Excellence Fund. The University's outreach activities intensified both throughout the state and around the globe. Michigan is now playing the leadership role in coordinating an unusual public/private sector effort to develop a reform agenda for K-12 education in Michigan, working closely with the Business Roundtable. Michigan faculty and students were active around the world, from the Pacific Rim to Eastern Europe, in a wide range of activities. Of particular note was the role of the Institute for Social Research in building new social science research centers in Poland and the Soviet Union. Closer to home, the University took an important step by moving ahead with an ambitious plan to make the campus a safer environment for living and 1991 Annual Report --CONFIDENTIAL-- 3 learning. Included in this was the formation of a campus police force and a major effort to improve lighting and transportation. The University also developed an important strategic plan to address the increasing challenge posed by substance abuse on college campuses, developed by a broad based task force chaired by George Zuidema. Progress continued on the Michigan Mandate, the University's efforts to better respond to the needs of a multicultural America, While the detailed progress was summarized in a report to the Regents last May, suffice it to note that: i) the University currently enrolls the largest number of minority students in its history--in every ethnic group, in every program, and at every level, ii) the University is among the national leaders in minority graduation rates, and iii) the University clearly has led the nation in recent years in its efforts to recruit outstanding minority faculty, with over 140 added in the past three years alone. While measures of institutional quality are generally measured in terms of individual achievements, the various programs of the University continue to be ranked among the nation's leaders. More specifically, in this year's U.S. News and World Report rankings, Michigan ranked 9th in the quality of undergraduate education, 5th in engineering, 6th in Law, 8th in Business, and 11th in Medicine. It should be noted that Michigan, Cornell, and Stanford were the only universities ranked among the national leaders in all four professional schools! (It should also be noted that Michigan is ranked 30th among major research universities in dollars spent per student--providing important evidence of our cost-effectiveness.) While this was not a banner year in Michigan athletics, we did manage to win our third straight Big Ten title in football and provided perhaps the most impressive performance in the nation on New Year's Day with our 31 to 0 victory over Mississippi in the Gator Bowl. Other Michigan sports, including men's and women's swimming, track, and tennis also excelled. And, while it was clearly a rebuilding year in basketball, Michigan finished the spring with what are regarded as the #1 recruiting classes in both basketball and football! I should also note that Michigan alumni succeeded in a friendly takeover of the New York sports scene, with Bob Nederlander as managing owner of the Yankees, Fred Wilpon of the Mets, and Bob Tisch of the New York Giants. Of course, one of the highlights of the year was Spring Commencement, when the University honored--and was honored by the presence of--President and Mrs. Bush in an extraordinary commencement ceremony, attended by over 1991 Annual Report --CONFIDENTIAL-- 4 70,000 spectators and 8,100 graduates. It was a moment of great pride for the University! While the items on this list would be extraordinary accomplishments for most universities, they are all part of business as usual at the University of Michigan. They also demonstrate that the affairs of the University are in the good hands of a remarkable group of faculty, students, and staff. 1.2. So Where Do We Stand in August, 1991? As I have said on many--perhaps too many--occasions, the pace of change in our society during the 1990s is accelerating at an extraordinary rate. We are being swept along toward the 21st Century by the forces of changing demographics, internationalization, and the increasingly central role played by knowledge in economic competitiveness and national security. As a result the United States, like the rest of the world, is changing rapidly. Hence higher education faces the challenge of both responding to and, to some degree, influencing this change process. In a very real sense, the 1990s will require a rethinking of the nature of the university--particularly, the public university--and I believe that the University of Michigan can and should play a leadership role in this effort. It goes without saying that our capacity to play such a leadership role in defining the nature of higher education for the 21st Century will be determined by a number of factors. Clearly our reputation as the flagship of public higher education for over a century, coupled with our unusual combination of program quality, size, and breadth are important. So too will be our firm commitment to protecting fundamental academic values and pursuing academic excellence. But I believe leadership will require more. It will require the capacity to attract and sustain individuals of extraordinary ability, vision, intellectual span, and leadership ability. It will require a bit more of a spirit of venturesomeness-- risk-taking--throughout the University. It will require addressing several of the serious resource issues presently faced by the University--including the tragic erosion in state support it has experienced throughout the 1970s and 1980s. It will require far more of a strategic focus on the part of University leadership. And it will require the strong understanding, commitment, and support of the Board of Regents to this leadership role. The importance of Michigan's leadership has become ever more apparent with each passing month. The scandals experienced by Stanford, the change in 1991 Annual Report --CONFIDENTIAL-- 5 leadership at Harvard, the budget difficulties faced by the University of California and many other public institutions, all mean suggest that there remain few universities today with both the capacity and the credibility to provide the necessary leadership. Michigan is one of that small group. We have a responsibility to step forward",https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/118694/Speeches-JJDS5c-jjd1241_bhl-09d117e8.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y,James Duderstadt,Male,7/1/88,1110,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Looking Inward,1/1/87,12/31/92,Public,Ann Arbor ,MI,Midwest,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",53,"All in all, this has been a quite remarkable year for the University. While a more extensive listing of various activities and events has been provided in my annual activities summary, let me note a few of the highlights. We began the academic year last fall with yet another series of exciting announcement from the genetic medicine research team led by Francis Collins. This group is doing some of the most exciting medical research in the world today (and we are told they are likely to receive the Nobel Prize in the next few years). They have systematically identified the genetic causes of several of our society's most crippling diseases--cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, diabetes, the inability to control cholesterol levels, and most recently focusing their attention on the genetic causes of breast cancer. Yet beyond this, Michigan scientists are attempting to develop gene therapy methods to deal with these tragic diseases. In many ways, the leadership being provided by Michigan's medical scientists today is similar to that it provided 40 years ago when it performed the clinical trials for the Salk vaccine. Further, as Professor Collins pointed out at one of last year's Regents' meetings, since genetic causes are key to many of today's most crippling diseases (heart disease, cancer, AIDs,...), the University is clearly providing leadership of great importance to our society. Last year our students provided similar excitement through the Sunrunner project: the effort to design, build, and race a solar-powered automobile in both national and world competitions. Last summer the Michigan team of 150 students won the national competitionand the right to represent the United States in the world competition in the outback of Western Australia. Competing against over 45 teams from countries throughout the world, Michigan finished third, behind only Swiss and Honda factory teams. It was a proud moment for the University. Michigan scholars continued to win high honors throughout the year. Last fall two Michigan faculty won the MacCarther Prize, Rebecca Scott and Sherry Orner, to be joined this June by Alice Fulton as yet another MacCarther winner. We also had a bumper crop of new members of the learned academies (Science, Engineering, Arts and Letters). And, while we continue to be under 1991 Annual Report --CONFIDENTIAL-- 2 serious raiding pressure, after reviewing this year's promotion case books, I believe that the quality of our faculty has never been higher. Several key facilities projects were completed. Last fall we were joined by an alumnus, United States Surgeon General Antonio Novello, to dedicate the new Child and Maternal Health Care Center. This spring, President Gerald Ford did the honors in dedicating Schembechler Hall. And, of course, this September when Michigan plays Notre Dame, we will break in the ""new"" Michigan Stadium with its lowered field and ""prescription athletic turf"". The University's impact in science and engineering continued at a leadership level. As you know, for the past several years the University, in partnership with IBM and MCI, has managed the principal computer network, the National Research and Education Network, linking together over three million users in universities, industrial and government research laboratories around the world. This effort has now become so successful that last fall UM, IBM, and MCI formed a nonprofit corporation, Advanced Network Services, Inc., to handle the next phase of the network at it evolves into what will eventually become the ""interstate highway system of information exchange"". This past spring ANS, Inc. spun off its first for-profit subsidiary. Incidentally, I would note that the University's efforts have positioned the State of Michigan quite well in the rapidly evolving information technology industry. In a similar vein, it was announced last fall that a team of Michigan engineers and scientists led by Professor Gerard Mourou, had built the world's most powerful laser. In December the National Science Foundation announced that Michigan had been selected as the site of a new $15 million National Science and Engineering Center in the Ultrafast Optics. I should note here that Mourou and his team were attracted to Michigan through the use of the Research Excellence Fund. The University's outreach activities intensified both throughout the state and around the globe. Michigan is now playing the leadership role in coordinating an unusual public/private sector effort to develop a reform agenda for K-12 education in Michigan, working closely with the Business Roundtable.

(Erich Bloch) 2 The Real Issue: The fundamental problem here is the degree to which the universities have allowed others to set the agenda, to determine both the focus and the nature of the debate concerning the role of higher education. It is clear that as long as we allow others to determine and control the agenda, we will continue to find ourselves on the defensive, responding to first one negative issue and then another. This continued siege of the academy will continue to erode public confidence and trust in the American university, at just that moment in our history in which we become even more dependent on these institutions. It seems clear that higher education must take steps to regain control of the agenda, to begin to control the public debate, changing or reshaping context of the debate to achieve a more positive emphasis. Key will be a well-conceived campaign to turn the nation's attention to what higher education is really all about: educating the young people of our nation for the challenges ahead, doing the research that will determine our prosperity and quality of life, and providing the leadership necessary for our nation in a rapidly changing world. The basic approach should probably include the following elements i) To first take some highly visible actions to respond to some of the criticisms and concerns--since they do contain some truth, and our public credibility requires demonstrating that we take criticism quite seriously. Here, however, we need to choose the battlefield quite carefully, responding only to a few of the more critical issues, and neutralizing others of less relevance or importance. ii) At the same time, we need to launch a parallel effort to push several positive themes relating to how the university is needed by our society in the 1990s and beyond. Examples might include: the education pipeline, economic competitiveness, and health care. iii) We need to take steps to build more permanent structures or organizations capable to continuing this effort for the long term.

55,bwn1,11/18/90,Brown University,One Is Too Many: Sexual Assault Is A National Tragedy and Disgrace,Message,Social CT,"During the past two years as President of Brown University I have spoken forcefully and without ambiguity against all forms of racism and intolerance and against physical assaults on our stu- dents. I have spoken with respect to both the fundamental principles of academic freedom and the rights of minorities, including the rights of a minority of one. I have spoken against sexual discrimination and the exploitation of women in our society. L have spoken about our University's duty and obligation to protect the dignity and the physical well-being of all of our students, as well as their academic and legal rights as citizens of our University. I have spoken about our Universe/s position in choosing marrers to two entering freshman chess and to two senior classes and during different orientation sessions for students and administrators alike. To remove any ambiguity about our stance on racism and discrimination on the basis of sex, I recommended to the Corporation to strengthen the Tenets of Community Behavior and the Code of Student Conduct. In addition I recommended the addition of an explicit statement on non-dis-crimination on the basis of sexual ori-entacion as part of the University's policy. I testified that the Corporation about these important changes. Ducing Parents' Weekend this Fall, 1 spoke to students and their parents about the rights of women, their dignity and their well-being. I stressed that we must resist those forces in our society that tend to marginalize and dehumanize women in any setting. The current controversy on our campus jovolves no issues. One is sexual assault in any form. Sexual assault is a nacional tragedy and a disgrace. It must be condemned without besira-tion and ambiguity. Statistics are not a solace, for one sexual assault is too many. It cannot and must not be tolerated. Following the [Nov. rs) forum on sexual assault, I instructed Deans Blumstein and Robinson to prepare a comprehensive report for the con-ceraed students and our community ar large, outlining the Universiry's current policies, programs of assistance, the judicial ssteer tear deals with sex- ual assault, and related matters such as harassencot. I asked the deans to outline ways to strengthen existing programs as well as to recommend addi-cional programs that must be added in order to cope with this national problem and assist the victims. I also informed both deans of my readiness and eagerness to meet with concerned students to assure them of my strong stance and support. I am gratified by the comprehensiveness of Dean Blumstein's November 16 report. I in turn have decided to recommend co the Corporation chat che Code of Student Conduce be amended to include separate provisions on sexual assault and racial/secu- all harassment as a major offense, making it clear that both are to be considered major offenses. Even though sexual assault is already mentioned in our rules, nevertheless I have taken this additional action in order to give this offense the prominence it deserves so that there can be no ambiguity whatsoever. The second issue involves the deliberate use of anonymous graffiti to defame and accuse specific students of serious criminal offenses. If there are alleged criminals in our midst, it is incumbent upon the victims to come forward promptly before either the University authorities or civil ones to take action. We must provide them assistance in doing so. If students have been hurt, harmed, or victimized, we owe it to them and to our community to try to bring the assailants to justice. The route of grailiti and anonymity whether against men or women is not an acceptable substitute for eicher due process or justice. I agree with the October 25 statement of the American Civil Liberties Union and its concern that it is incumbent upon universities to protect freedom of speech and due process as well. I am issuing this statement today, after I have shared it with the student rep-resentarives, for I have had an opportunity to meet with them only today: 1 wanted them so be the first ones to know of my stance.

58,bwn4,4/29/92,Brown University,Special Report from the President,Message,Campus CT,"Dear Brown Parent: April 29, 1992 April has been an exceptionally hectic month at Brown. We had the privilege of having UNICEF goodwill ambassador Audrey Hepburn host our annual Feinstein World Hunger Award Program, honoring those who contributed to reducing or preventing world hunger. This year's award winners included James C. Ingram, executive director of the World Food Programme; the Developing Countries Farm Radio Network; and The CORDES Foundation, on behalf of the repatriating villagers of El Salvador. In addition, we launched the Presidential Lecture Series with a talk by Lord Noel Annan on Margaret Thatcher's government; we dedicated the Howard R. Swearer Center for Public Service; and we began preparations for Commencement. This year, in celebration of 100 Years of Women at Brown, we will be honoring at least six distinguished women among our honorary degree candidates. The Commencement celebration next month includes a benefit concert by a Brown parent, noted flutist Eugenia Zukerman, playing with the Brown University Orchestra. Further, and most critical to the University's future, we kicked off a major fund established visiting fellowships in honor of the late J. Saunders Redding '28, A.M. '32, the first black Fellow of the Brown Corporation and the first black faculty member to teach in the Ivy League (1949 at Brown); we held a concert to benefit financial aid in New York's Avery Fisher Hall with the Brown University Orchestra playing with world-class violinist and Brown parent Izhak Perlman; and last week - and most unhappy - we had to arrest 253 Brown students to remove them from forcibly occupying our main administrative building. This building occupation, protesting our alleged lack of commitment to providing sufficient financial aid, was Brown's first building takeover since 1975. But more on that regretable incident later in this letter. We had an extremely successful kickoff of the campaign on April 11. At an all-University convocation, Chancellor Alva Way announced we already had received $163 million in advance gifts and pledges. I am pleased to tell you that 100 percent of the Brown Corporation, its governing body of 54 members, has contributed, and at this date 96 percent of former members have contributed as well. We have established faculty and student campaign committees, and we are looking for similar participation from those groups. Many parents have already been involved in this effort. One of them, Charles Rosenthal, chaired and did much of the work for the success of the Perlman benefit concert in New York. Some other parents, including Morley Safer and Anna Strasberg, participated in the kickoff events. The campaign goals are ambitious and include: • $110 million in endowment to strengthen our faculty, both for distinguished senior professors and exceptionally promising assistant professors. This includes $25 million for graduate fellowships. • $40 million (more if we can raise it!) in endowment for undergraduate scholarships. • $25 million in support of the University's library system. • $90 million to support our interdisciplinary programs, centers and institutes, research, and curricular initiatives. • $15 million for national outreach and new initiatives to keep Brown in the forefront of higher education in the nation. • $50 million for clinical professorships, including $10 in scholarship funds, in the School of Medicine. • $10 million in endowment for our athletic programs. • $55 million for new and renovated academic facilities, including a new multi-purpose sciences building, new classroom space and renovated spaces for academic departments. • $55 million from the Brown Annual Fund, which provides, outside of tuition income, our most important source of unrestricted funds for current use, including scholarship support. In the fall, we will begin to kick off various regional campaigns around the country. By the time the campaign concludes in December 1995, we will have touched every constituency, both here and abroad, and the financial base of this University will be on a firmer foundation. I sincerely hope that you will join us in this effort. You will be hearing more about the campaign as it progresses. udents ive own to d on Icial d al by na tion lents ella The Demonstration On April 22, some 300 students forcibly took over University Hall, Brown's main administrative building, protesting the University's alleged lack of commitment to ""need-blind"" admission. Need-blind admission, a goal to which Brown certainly aspires, means that Brown would be able to admit any qualified student regardless of financial need. Let's look for a moment at the financial aid picture at Brown. Some 32 percent of Brown students receive University financial aid, and about 39 percent are receiving aid from Brown and other sources as well. Currently, despite spending $19.2 million of the University's own funds this year on financial aid, we still cannot afford to accept an entire freshman class without regard to their financial need. You should know that this $19.2 million is approximately twice what we spend on our library and more than four-fifths of all faculty salaries. Financial aid is our only budget that has not been cut since 1989. In this fiscal year, the total University budget rose 4.6 percent while financial aid rose 8.9 percent; next year we have held our overall budget increase to 4.3 percent, but financial aid will increase 7 percent. Financial aid has been the only budget item that we have exempted from freezes or cuts. It i the only budget item indexed to increases in total costs, something our sister institutions have been unwilling to do. Increasing financial aid for all Brown students as well as undergraduates ¿raduate and medical student: has been one of my highest priorities, as I have stated on many occasions. I have been fighting throughout my time at Brown to put access to highet education on the national agenda. I have worked hard on this, and I have invited committed students to join me in that effort. Throughout the three years of my presidency, the issue of increasing financial aid and achieving need-blind admission has been one of the most discussed topics on campus. There is no lack of dialogue about this issue, only refusal by some to accept the outcome of the discussions. Since the 1980s, it has been a major preoccupation of the Corporation and several of its major committees, along with various faculty committees, including the Committee on Admission and Financial Aid (CAFA). Over the past three years leaders of SOFA (Students Organized for Financial Aid) and later its successor organization SAMA (Students for Aid and Minority Admissions) David Gardner '92, Libero Della Piana '93, Jesse Sharkey '92, among others have been members of our budget planning group, the Advisory Committee on University Planning (ACUP). Indeed, even this week ACUP will be addressing financial aid at its meeting. I have regular meetings with members of the Undergraduate Council of Students, leaders of the Third World organizations at Brown, and members of the Campus Minority Affairs Committee. I have always responded to any petitions, the most recent being my five-page response of April 22 outlining steps we have taken since 1989 to address issues openly concerning financial aid. The entire issue of need-blind admission has been thoroughly discussed by ACUP, CAFA, the Budget and Finance committee of the Corporation, the Advisory and Executive committee of the Corporation, as well as the entire Corporation itself. As you have read at the beginning of this letter, the goals of our new $450-million campaign include $75 million for financial support for students and $40 million of that specifically for undergraduates. In its entire 228-year history, Brown has managed to raise only $50 million in endowment for undergraduate and graduate financial aid; in February we committed to raise one and a half times that much by December 1995. (To achieve need-blind admission for undergraduates would require an additional $4.4 million a year, or another $88 million raised for financial aid endowment—more than twice what we believe we can accomplish!) The goal of $40 million for undergraduate financial aid was set by ACUP and the Corporation. No aspect of the goal-setting was given more consideration than this one. No aspect received more input from the campus community, including that of students. Two years ago, at the urging of SOFA members, the Corporation considered an $80-million goal and debated whether or not such a goal was achievable. The best advice from our fund-raising consultants, leaders in our development staff, past experience and colleagues in the field told us that achieving $40 million for financial aid would be difficult indeed, and we would have to pull out all the stops to accomplish it. I am sure you understand that it would be misleading, and even unproductive, for us to establish unrealistic and unachievable goals. It would only lead to failure in this campaign and difficulty in establishing credibility for the next one. Of course, I welcome any and all contributions to financial aid and the campaign, and if we top $500 million, I will be the first to cheer. Given my attention to this issue, you can imagine my shock when a group of students, who felt that Brown's commitment toward this priority was less than it should be, occupied University Hall and disrupted University operations, including class registration of other students, for an entire day. It is ironic that this protest took place just after we announced a campaign with a major commitment for financial aid and just before a concert in New York specifically benefiting financial aid. I am chagrined that we first learned about a possible takeover from the press who called to ask if it had occurred yet. The students had announced to the press what they were going to do before talking to us. Evidently, their takeover was more important than discussion. tam a firm believer in any group's right to dissenting views. In fact, we gave permission to the first cohort of students to enter University Hall to sit in and express their views. But as president of Brown, I have an obligation to protect the building that houses many of our financial records, student records, and many of our administrative offices. These students were warned throughout the day that they were disrupting University operations and had to leave the building by the time the building closed at 5 pm. Let me repeat that from 1 pm on. the University was clear in its intentions, and any student could have left the building during the next four hours without any consequences-and many did. These consequences were clearly described to them both orally and in writing. At the time of the takeover, I was briefly out of town at a funeral and on fundraising business for the University. A committee of deans, faculty and senior administrators decided that we had no choice but to clear the building by 5 pm to regain control of the management of this institution and its important functions. Provost Frank Rothman, in his capacity as acting-president, joined this group in late afternoon. I was in constant telephone contact and was fully informed of their decisions-and I supported them. In the afternoon, the students were told that we were acquiring a temporary restraining order from the Superior Court of Rhode Island and if they did not leave the building by 5 pm, they would be arrested. At 5 pm, some 60-70 students voluntarily left the building. The remaining 253 students chose to be arrested. It is clear that the students who remained behind to be arrested did so voluntarily to make a statement. The arrests were made peacefully by Brown police officers, who escorted the students to buses for transport downtown where they were charged. A number of Brown deans and faculty members accompanied the students on the buses and remained with them at the police station. vork. Students ord ilding and turn it d not comply.)

It is a report no president wants to make to parents or its trustees and friends. While I am a firm believer in a person's right to engage in civil disobedience, I also believe that those who engage in those activities must also take responsibility for their actions and be held accountable for them. It is important that you understand that this was not a peaceful protest. Some 200-250 students literally stormed the building, knocking our police officers and administrators to the floor. Two officers suffered considerable bruising. Staff members working in University Hall felt threatened and some secretaries had to lock themselves in their offices in fear of their own safety. One group, ordering staff members to leave, tried to shut down the Registrar's office, but the staff stayed to protect student records. Reports from other staff members, including my assistant John McIntyre and faculty in the building, stated that the disruption was preventing them from carrying out their work. Students ordered senior officers and members of the faculty to leave the building and turn it over to the students if they wanted to avoid violence. (They did not comply.) There were moments when the student leaders were losing control of the crowd, and violence and serious damage became a real possibility. While I would never deny anyone the right to protest and peacefully demonstrate to express his or her views, I and my administration draw the line at demonstrations that threaten the security of others, and that disrupt the normal functioning of the University and the rights of others to do their jobs. WARCH '92) Some 65 percent of the occupying students were freshmen and sophomores, and I am sure that many did not believe that the University would hold them accountable for their actions. In a conciliatory effort, we are not pressing three of the five charges that could have been filed. But because of the egregiousness of the students' behavior, including their defying a court order, we intend to hold the 253 students accountable for violating two Rhode Island statutes ""Willful trespass within school buildings,"" which carries a mandatory fine that could range from a minimum of $50 to a maximum of $500, and ""Prevention from carrying on employment,"" which carries a maximum penalty of $100 and 90 days in jail. The court has scheduled those cases to be heard today, April 29. If you are the parent of one of the 253 students charged, you may in fact hear the outcome of those hearings from your student even before receiving this letter. The 253 who were arrested, and some who left the building pror to the arrests, are also subject to the University's own disciplinary process, and a decision on what charges might be filed under that system will be made shortly. I have pledged that we would raise as much as we could to support financial aid. I had expressed hope that the campaign goal would be $500 million, but I am an optimist and, one might say, I am bullish on Brown. We might indeed raise $500 million, and I certainly hope we will, for we have many needs at Brown, many priorities faculty support, the library, academic program support, the School of Medicine, and so on. All I can say is that, with the help of our dedicated students, our faculty and staff, our alumni and alumnae, parents and friends, we will do our best to achieve and surpass the goals for each of those priorities. We cannot ignore one in favor of the other. I have offered four student leaders of this demonstration the opportunity to meet with our campaign leadership to discuss their concerns and continue the dialogue. We must now turn our attention to capturing the extraordinary energy shown by these students and direct it to the cause of democratization of access to higher education in general, and to Brown in particular. While I am disappointed that the leaders of this demonstration have not joined my efforts to build a national coalition of many universities and organizations to influence federal legislation regarding student aid, I remain hopeful that they-and committed students like them across the country—will do so and help achieve our common goals. Finally, I want to thank you for your understanding and your patience. The deans have been returning your phone calls as quickly as possible, and I hope your most immediate questions and concerns have now been answered. While I have your attention, let me describe how many of our alumni and alumnae have been helping our students make the transition from university life to lives, in the words of our charter, ""of usefulness and reputation."" Brown has for some 20 years utilized alumni-one of our most valuable natural -in helping undergraduates to plan their careers. All our programs are designed to serve needs we know exist. We constantly try to create new ways to build bridges between students and alumni, for students to benefit from the experiences of our alumni, and for alumni to gain from the enthusiasm and energy of our bright and involved students. Approximately 3,700 alumni and a handful of parents are involved in a broad array of Alumni Relations career programs, many of which have served as models for other universities interested in starting student-alumni activities. News of our programs reaches all undergraduates on a regular basis; approximately 4,000 students annually participate in some area of student-alumni activity. Our career-related programs include: Alumni Career Forums Alumni Relations and Career Planning Services co-sponsor at least 10 Friday afternoon forums annually. Over 50 alumni who are executives in an array of fields-including alumni of the graduate school—as well as younger graduates who can relate better to students just leaving college, return to campus each year to speak on topics spanning the career spectrum, from more conventional (careers in law, publishing, advertising) to less traditional (careers in philanthropy and foundations, using computers creatively). At least one Alumni Career Forum each year deals specifically with working in the area of public service. All forums are audio taped; we reach an audience of approximately 800 students annually with this program. Our alumni volunteer to speak to students about their careers; they pay their own way to campus and give up a Friday to be here. Apprenticeships: Internships with Brown Alumni January and summer breaks are traditionally times when students seek employment. Alumni offer to sponsor students in their places of work during both breaks, either on a volunteer or paid basis. In 1992 over 150 alumni, including a handful of international alumni, offered apprenticeship opportunities. For example, Kathryn Fuller'68, president of World Wildlife Fund, and Wendy Strothman '72, director of The Beacon Press, regularly offer apprenticeships; jobs range from working in a painter's studio to shadowing a hand surgeon, from assisting in the New York Bureau of Air Policy to helping organize the Portland, Oregon, Waterfront Blues Festival. Information Interviewing: The Alumni Network Over 2,700 alumni (U.S. and international) volunteer to serve as information interviewing resources to students and to other alumni, who may ask them questions about their careers, graduate school experiences, and other major life decisions.

We had the privilege of having UNICEF goodwill ambassador Audrey Hepburn host our annual Feinstein World Hunger Award Program, honoring those who contributed to reducing or preventing world hunger. This year's award winners included James C. Ingram, executive director of the World Food Programme; the Developing Countries Farm Radio Network; and The CORDES Foundation, on behalf of the repatriating villagers of El Salvador. In addition, we launched the Presidential Lecture Series with a talk by Lord Noel Annan on Margaret Thatcher's government; we dedicated the Howard R. Swearer Center for Public Service; and we began preparations for Commencement. This year, in celebration of 100 Years of Women at Brown, we will be honoring at least six distinguished women among our honorary degree candidates. The Commencement celebration next month includes a benefit concert by a Brown parent, noted flutist Eugenia Zukerman, playing with the Brown University Orchestra. Further, and most critical to the University's future, we kicked off a major fund established visiting fellowships in honor of the late J. Saunders Redding '28, A.M. '32, the first black Fellow of the Brown Corporation and the first black faculty member to teach in the Ivy League (1949 at Brown); we held a concert to benefit financial aid in New York's Avery Fisher Hall with the Brown University Orchestra playing with world-class violinist and Brown parent Izhak Perlman; and last week - and most unhappy - we had to arrest 253 Brown students to remove them from forcibly occupying our main administrative building. This building occupation, protesting our alleged lack of commitment to providing sufficient financial aid, was Brown's first building takeover since 1975. But more on that regretable incident later in this letter. We had an extremely successful kickoff of the campaign on April 11. At an all-University convocation, Chancellor Alva Way announced we already had received $163 million in advance gifts and pledges. I am pleased to tell you that 100 percent of the Brown Corporation, its governing body of 54 members, has contributed, and at this date 96 percent of former members have contributed as well. We have established faculty and student campaign committees, and we are looking for similar participation from those groups. Many parents have already been involved in this effort. One of them, Charles Rosenthal, chaired and did much of the work for the success of the Perlman benefit concert in New York. Some other parents, including Morley Safer and Anna Strasberg, participated in the kickoff events. The campaign goals are ambitious and include: • $110 million in endowment to strengthen our faculty, both for distinguished senior professors and exceptionally promising assistant professors. This includes $25 million for graduate fellowships. • $40 million (more if we can raise it!) in endowment for undergraduate scholarships. • $25 million in support of the University's library system. • $90 million to support our interdisciplinary programs, centers and institutes, research, and curricular initiatives. • $15 million for national outreach and new initiatives to keep Brown in the forefront of higher education in the nation. • $50 million for clinical professorships, including $10 in scholarship funds, in the School of Medicine. • $10 million in endowment for our athletic programs. • $55 million for new and renovated academic facilities, including a new multi-purpose sciences building, new classroom space and renovated spaces for academic departments. • $55 million from the Brown Annual Fund, which provides, outside of tuition income, our most important source of unrestricted funds for current use, including scholarship support. In the fall, we will begin to kick off various regional campaigns around the country. By the time the campaign concludes in December 1995, we will have touched every constituency, both here and abroad, and the financial base of this University will be on a firmer foundation. I sincerely hope that you will join us in this effort. You will be hearing more about the campaign as it progresses. udents ive own to d on Icial d al by na tion lents ella The Demonstration On April 22, some 300 students forcibly took over University Hall, Brown's main administrative building, protesting the University's alleged lack of commitment to ""need-blind"" admission. Need-blind admission, a goal to which Brown certainly aspires, means that Brown would be able to admit any qualified student regardless of financial need. Let's look for a moment at the financial aid picture at Brown. Some 32 percent of Brown students receive University financial aid, and about 39 percent are receiving aid from Brown and other sources as well. Currently, despite spending $19.2 million of the University's own funds this year on financial aid, we still cannot afford to accept an entire freshman class without regard to their financial need. You should know that this $19.2 million is approximately twice what we spend on our library and more than four-fifths of all faculty salaries. Financial aid is our only budget that has not been cut since 1989. In this fiscal year, the total University budget rose 4.6 percent while financial aid rose 8.9 percent; next year we have held our overall budget increase to 4.3 percent, but financial aid will increase 7 percent. Financial aid has been the only budget item that we have exempted from freezes or cuts. It i the only budget item indexed to increases in total costs, something our sister institutions have been unwilling to do. Increasing financial aid for all Brown students as well as undergraduates ¿raduate and medical student: has been one of my highest priorities, as I have stated on many occasions. I have been fighting throughout my time at Brown to put access to highet education on the national agenda. I have worked hard on this, and I have invited committed students to join me in that effort. Throughout the three years of my presidency, the issue of increasing financial aid and achieving need-blind admission has been one of the most discussed topics on campus. There is no lack of dialogue about this issue, only refusal by some to accept the outcome of the discussions. Since the 1980s, it has been a major preoccupation of the Corporation and several of its major committees, along with various faculty committees, including the Committee on Admission and Financial Aid (CAFA). Over the past three years leaders of SOFA (Students Organized for Financial Aid) and later its successor organization SAMA (Students for Aid and Minority Admissions) David Gardner '92, Libero Della Piana '93, Jesse Sharkey '92, among others have been members of our budget planning group, the Advisory Committee on University Planning (ACUP). Indeed, even this week ACUP will be addressing financial aid at its meeting. I have regular meetings with members of the Undergraduate Council of Students, leaders of the Third World organizations at Brown, and members of the Campus Minority Affairs Committee. I have always responded to any petitions, the most recent being my five-page response of April 22 outlining steps we have taken since 1989 to address issues openly concerning financial aid. The entire issue of need-blind admission has been thoroughly discussed by ACUP, CAFA, the Budget and Finance committee of the Corporation, the Advisory and Executive committee of the Corporation, as well as the entire Corporation itself. As you have read at the beginning of this letter, the goals of our new $450-million campaign include $75 million for financial support for students and $40 million of that specifically for undergraduates. In its entire 228-year history, Brown has managed to raise only $50 million in endowment for undergraduate and graduate financial aid; in February we committed to raise one and a half times that much by December 1995. (To achieve need-blind admission for undergraduates would require an additional $4.4 million a year, or another $88 million raised for financial aid endowment—more than twice what we believe we can accomplish!) The goal of $40 million for undergraduate financial aid was set by ACUP and the Corporation. No aspect of the goal-setting was given more consideration than this one. No aspect received more input from the campus community, including that of students. Two years ago, at the urging of SOFA members, the Corporation considered an $80-million goal and debated whether or not such a goal was achievable. The best advice from our fund-raising consultants, leaders in our development staff, past experience and colleagues in the field told us that achieving $40 million for financial aid would be difficult indeed, and we would have to pull out all the stops to accomplish it. I am sure you understand that it would be misleading, and even unproductive, for us to establish unrealistic and unachievable goals. It would only lead to failure in this campaign and difficulty in establishing credibility for the next one. Of course, I welcome any and all contributions to financial aid and the campaign, and if we top $500 million, I will be the first to cheer. Given my attention to this issue, you can imagine my shock when a group of students, who felt that Brown's commitment toward this priority was less than it should be, occupied University Hall and disrupted University operations, including class registration of other students, for an entire day. It is ironic that this protest took place just after we announced a campaign with a major commitment for financial aid and just before a concert in New York specifically benefiting financial aid. I am chagrined that we first learned about a possible takeover from the press who called to ask if it had occurred yet. The students had announced to the press what they were going to do before talking to us. Evidently, their takeover was more important than discussion. tam a firm believer in any group's right to dissenting views. In fact, we gave permission to the first cohort of students to enter University Hall to sit in and express their views. But as president of Brown, I have an obligation to protect the building that houses many of our financial records, student records, and many of our administrative offices. These students were warned throughout the day that they were disrupting University operations and had to leave the building by the time the building closed at 5 pm. Let me repeat that from 1 pm on. the University was clear in its intentions, and any student could have left the building during the next four hours without any consequences-and many did. These consequences were clearly described to them both orally and in writing. At the time of the takeover, I was briefly out of town at a funeral and on fundraising business for the University. A committee of deans, faculty and senior administrators decided that we had no choice but to clear the building by 5 pm to regain control of the management of this institution and its important functions. Provost Frank Rothman, in his capacity as acting-president, joined this group in late afternoon. I was in constant telephone contact and was fully informed of their decisions-and I supported them. In the afternoon, the students were told that we were acquiring a temporary restraining order from the Superior Court of Rhode Island and if they did not leave the building by 5 pm, they would be arrested. At 5 pm, some 60-70 students voluntarily left the building. The remaining 253 students chose to be arrested. It is clear that the students who remained behind to be arrested did so voluntarily to make a statement. The arrests were made peacefully by Brown police officers, who escorted the students to buses for transport downtown where they were charged. A number of Brown deans and faculty members accompanied the students on the buses and remained with them at the police station. vork. Students ord ilding and turn it d not comply.)

It is a report no president wants to make to parents or its trustees and friends. While I am a firm believer in a person's right to engage in civil disobedience, I also believe that those who engage in those activities must also take responsibility for their actions and be held accountable for them. It is important that you understand that this was not a peaceful protest. Some 200-250 students literally stormed the building, knocking our police officers and administrators to the floor. Two officers suffered considerable bruising. Staff members working in University Hall felt threatened and some secretaries had to lock themselves in their offices in fear of their own safety. One group, ordering staff members to leave, tried to shut down the Registrar's office, but the staff stayed to protect student records. Reports from other staff members, including my assistant John McIntyre and faculty in the building, stated that the disruption was preventing them from carrying out their work. Students ordered senior officers and members of the faculty to leave the building and turn it over to the students if they wanted to avoid violence. (They did not comply.) There were moments when the student leaders were losing control of the crowd, and violence and serious damage became a real possibility. While I would never deny anyone the right to protest and peacefully demonstrate to express his or her views, I and my administration draw the line at demonstrations that threaten the security of others, and that disrupt the normal functioning of the University and the rights of others to do their jobs. WARCH '92) Some 65 percent of the occupying students were freshmen and sophomores, and I am sure that many did not believe that the University would hold them accountable for their actions. In a conciliatory effort, we are not pressing three of the five charges that could have been filed. But because of the egregiousness of the students' behavior, including their defying a court order, we intend to hold the 253 students accountable for violating two Rhode Island statutes ""Willful trespass within school buildings,"" which carries a mandatory fine that could range from a minimum of $50 to a maximum of $500, and ""Prevention from carrying on employment,"" which carries a maximum penalty of $100 and 90 days in jail. The court has scheduled those cases to be heard today, April 29. If you are the parent of one of the 253 students charged, you may in fact hear the outcome of those hearings from your student even before receiving this letter. The 253 who were arrested, and some who left the building pror to the arrests, are also subject to the University's own disciplinary process, and a decision on what charges might be filed under that system will be made shortly. I have pledged that we would raise as much as we could to support financial aid. I had expressed hope that the campaign goal would be $500 million, but I am an optimist and, one might say, I am bullish on Brown. We might indeed raise $500 million, and I certainly hope we will, for we have many needs at Brown, many priorities faculty support, the library, academic program support, the School of Medicine, and so on. All I can say is that, with the help of our dedicated students, our faculty and staff, our alumni and alumnae, parents and friends, we will do our best to achieve and surpass the goals for each of those priorities. We cannot ignore one in favor of the other. I have offered four student leaders of this demonstration the opportunity to meet with our campaign leadership to discuss their concerns and continue the dialogue. We must now turn our attention to capturing the extraordinary energy shown by these students and direct it to the cause of democratization of access to higher education in general, and to Brown in particular.

60,bwn6,3/31/92,Brown University,Financial Aid and Minority Admissions,Message,Campus CT,"During the last month, a petition was circulated on campus asking that the director of financial aid, for whom a search is underway, be ""a qualified person of color."" On Tues-day, March 17, a group of students representing Students for Aid and Minority Admissions (SAMA), the Third World Coalition and the Undergraduate Council of Students visited my office and presented me that petition with the signatures of approximately 1,700 members of the Brown community. In addition, those students handed me an unsigned memorandum which made further comments along with five demands. Because I cannot respond individually to the 1,700 signers of the petition, I have decided to write to the entire University community so that the signers will receive my answer and others may read about the University's initiatives and priorities. First, let me correct some errors of fact. The petition asserts that minority enrollment ""is dropping at an alarming rate."" Minority enrollment is not dropping at all. Since my arrival at Brown there has been a steady increase in minority enrollments, from 24 to 26 percent. The petition also asserts that a director of financial aid who is a person of color could be a leader in ""reviving the administration's commitment to pluralism."" The administration's commitment is not in need of revival. It is robust and will continue so. As you may already know, there is a search committee for the director of financial aid position. It is chaired by Prof. James Wyche, associate provost for minority affairs. The committee includes faculty, staff and students and represents all segments of the Brown community, including minorities. Prof. Wyche has assured me that the search will be as broad as possible. I have full confidence in his leadership, ability and integrity. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the committee is aware of and sensitive to the concerns of all students, including minorities, and that it will act in the best interests of the University and its students. I have transmitted a copy of the petition to Prof. Wyche's committee. Brown University has long adhered to the principle of equal employment opportunity. William Baily, Brown's director of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action, and Beverly Ledbetter, vice president and general counsel, have confirmed that placing racial, ethnic, gender or other restrictions on a search of this kind would violate the spirit and letter of Brown's own policies and would be contrary to federal guidelines. I will not restrict the search as the petition requests. Our aim is to find and hire the best person for the job. Finally, the petition mentions a director of financial aid who is ""responsible to the student body."" The unsigned memo goes even further, demanding that the director be ""account- able"" directly to student groups, including the Third World Coalition, SOFA, SOA the UCS. The director of financial aid. whoever he or she is, will report to the dean responsible to the Brown Corporation and the Brown community. mission and financial aid, who renorts to the provost.

The second document presented to me that morning was a list of five ""demands,"" including a demand that I present myself at a certain time and place to respond to the petition and to the other so-called demands. The crux of this second document was financial aid policies. While I do not consider demands, I am always willing to speak about issues of campus concern and, where there are problems, to find solutions. Need-Blind Admissions All members of the Brown community support the ideal of need-blind admissions. The major unresolved issue is how we can raise the necessary resources to make need-blind admissions a reality. From time to time in the current campus discussion, I have heard people say they are tired of hearing that Brown does not have enough money to achieve need-blind admissions. So are we all. Anyone who has listened to discussions of ACUP, of the A&E Committee, of the Corporation, of the faculty or of the UCS for that matter cannot have missed a discussion of University finances. Indeed, the University's discussion of financial matters has been open to the campus community, reported in the press and summarized in public doc-uments. Few institutions air these matters so publicly. It should be clear to everyone that our financial constraints are real, are serious and cannot be waved off or wished away. Although we are restricted on all sides by our modest resources, I continue to be amazed at how much this University does and how well it does it. Our lack of adequate financial resources must never be confused with a failure of will or a confusion of priorities. Undergraduate financial aid is one of our highest prionities, second only to support of our excellent faculty. This priority will be refiected in the s450-million comprehensive campaign financial aid situation: which we will announce next week and in steps Brown has already taken to improve the • The financial aid budget is now linked to tuition and fee increases.

In this regard, the Campus Minority Affairs Committee (CMAC), chaired by Prof. Lina Fruzzetti, has been instrumental and I appreciate the committee's efforts. One minor, yet revealing point: I was disturbed to notice that the word ""qualified"" had been inserted before the phrase ""person of color"" on the petition which was presented to me. This struck me as condescending. Persons of color who have achieved distinction should not have to answer the canard that it was special considerations, not qualifications, which brought them success. The second document presented to me that morning was a list of five ""demands,"" including a demand that I present myself at a certain time and place to respond to the petition and to the other so-called demands. The crux of this second document was financial aid policies. While I do not consider demands, I am always willing to speak about issues of campus concern and, where there are problems, to find solutions. Need-Blind Admissions All members of the Brown community support the ideal of need-blind admissions. The major unresolved issue is how we can raise the necessary resources to make need-blind admissions a reality. From time to time in the current campus discussion, I have heard people say they are tired of hearing that Brown does not have enough money to achieve need-blind admissions. So are we all. Anyone who has listened to discussions of ACUP, of the A&E Committee, of the Corporation, of the faculty or of the UCS for that matter cannot have missed a discussion of University finances. Indeed, the University's discussion of financial matters has been open to the campus community, reported in the press and summarized in public doc-uments. Few institutions air these matters so publicly. It should be clear to everyone that our financial constraints are real, are serious and cannot be waved off or wished away. Although we are restricted on all sides by our modest resources, I continue to be amazed at how much this University does and how well it does it. Our lack of adequate financial resources must never be confused with a failure of will or a confusion of priorities. Undergraduate financial aid is one of our highest priorities, second only to support of our excellent faculty. This priority will be refiected in the $450-million comprehensive campaign financial aid situation: which we will announce next week and in steps Brown has already taken to improve the • The financial aid budget is now linked to tuition and fee increases. In May of 1990, 1 announced that the University would provide a floor for the financial aid budget (about $16 million at the time) and would raise that floor in direct proportion to increases in tuition and fees. Financial aid funds will at least keep pace with rising costs. This measure was welcomed by all parties concerned with financial aid. All new financial aid endowment is added to the budget. In most areas of the Univer-sity, increased funds generated by endowment allow the University to redirect the support it had provided from the general fund to other priorities. Not so with financial aid. Every dollar generated by new financial aid endowment will be added to the financial aid budget. The University will not reduce the level of its commitment from general operating funds. • $40-million goal for Campaign. The University has set an ambitious goal to raise $40 million for financial aid endowment during the comprehensive campaign. That is half of what Brown raised for endowments of all purposes during the 1980s, a time of legendary economic expansion. We are operating in vastly different economic circum-Stances. If we achieve that $40-million goal, the financial aid budget will receive an additional $2 million every year. I emphasize that $40 million is our goal; nothing prevents us from raising significantly more. I see no purpose to be served, however, by setting a symbolic, unrealistic goal of $80 million and not succeeding. We cannot afford to fail. If the $450-million campaign goal is increased, all components will be increased • S35-million Campaign goal for other financial aid. I said I would address undergraduate issues in this memo, but I cannot ignore another aspect of financial aid. Brown has financial aid commitments to graduate and medical students as well as to undergradu-ates. The University assigned campaign goals of $25 million for graduate students and $10 million for medical students, bringing the total goal for financial aid endowment to $75 million, an immense challenge. We are attempting to raise in five years nearly as much as Brown has raised for financial aid endowment in 228 years. • The Investment in Diversity has doubled in the last two years. Under the leadership of Third World alumni, this special fund-raising effort for financial aid has doubled in the last two years to more than $1 million and continues to grow. • The financial aid budget has been exempt from reallocations. All other areas of the University except the library have had to struggle to meet budget reduction goals as the University restructures its budget to solve some long-term problems. • Brown has made extraordinary efforts to meet financial aid emergencies. Most recently, when returning students had greater than anticipated financial need for the current year, I created an emergency fund to meet that need. I will repeat what I said in the spring of 1990: Brown has made financial aid endowment a priority in the new Campaign. This will test whether our wider community of alumni, parents and friends will support progress toward our goal. We will need the full mobilization of everyone if the Campaign goal and its goal for financial aid endowment are to be achieved. Making Our Case Nationally Providing equal access to higher education is a national challenge. Federal support fo higher education has not been keeping pace with demonstrated need. Prior to the 1980: federal support for college and university students was evenly divided between grant ar loan money. Now 80 percent is loan money. Affording education is becoming mo difficult in virtually all sectors. Universities alone, especially ones which have financ handicaps, cannot solve this national problem alone. 1 hope we are seeine the beginnings of a reversal. My colleagues at other instit have been working assiduously on this problem, and I was delighted to see tha House of Representatives recently voted 365 to 3 to make Pell Grants and guaran Aent loans available to many more American families A similar measure has been by the Senate. The House bill would boost maximum grants to $4,500 from $2,41 earning more than $28,000 is generally ineligible under current rules.) would extend eligibility to families with annual incomes up to $49,000. (A family ox, Effective government and community relations are of growing importance to the Unive sitv. I have created a new vice presidential nosition within University Relations and have Diven it responcibility for coordinating the University's relationshid with all levels of gov. ernment as well as with the Providence and Rhode Island communities. I am pleased 10 re port that Levi C. Adams, who has been a superbly eftective representative for Brown's Medical School since its inception, has agreed to take on this new challenge. The University will continue to press for adequate financial aid for the nation's youth, including those who choose to come to Brown. I have asked Executive Vice President Robert A. Reichley and Vice President Adams to redouble their efforts in this regard. Access to education is a national problem and must become a national priority. I urge all students and their parents who feel strongly about financial aid to inform themselves about governmental policies in this regard, particularly in this election year, and to involve themselves directly so that student concerns may be brought to bear upon legislation and the formation of government policy. Diversity and Minority Recruitment Unless it breaks faith with its heritage and violates its own institutional convictions, Brown University will never become an exclusive haven for the wealthy and privileged. Brown is committed to pluralism and diversity of all kinds - racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, religious - as well as to a significant representation from other nations of the world. Just as we would never declare ourselves to be otherwise, so we will not allow our commitment to diversity to be eroded through inattention to some very serious problems. First let me clear up an item of misinformation which appears to be circulating on campus. It has been suggested that Brown does not actively recruit in the nation's inner-city areas or among Native Americans on reservations. This is simply not true. I have consulted with Dean Widmer, who assures me that the University has an aggressive recruitment policy for all segments of the college-age population, including minorities: • Brown's admission officers have made special efforts in more than two dozen major inner-city areas, including Newark, New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington. • Brown representatives visit reservation schools in the Southwest, meet Native American students at regional college recruitment fairs, and visit native peoples in Alaska. A single admission officer logged more than 52,000 miles this year doing precisely this kind of recruitment. • The pool of black applicants has been increasing and grew 19 percent over last year. Pools for other minority groups are increasing as well. • Half of Brown's 16 admission officers are minorities, a far greater percentage than any of the institutions with which we usually compare ourselves. recruitment effort is among them. Rather, I worry about two related issues. The first is finding enough financial aid resources to meet the needs of all students. particularly high-hinding enouch tinancial aid resources to meet the neeas or all students. particularly hich. need students, primary and secondary education system is failing many of our young people. who have been admitted to Brown. The second is the fact that our nation's You have heard some of the more sensational accounts of these failures - high school graduates who cannot read a newspaper and so forth. I am profoundly saddened by students whom our nation has failed in this way. Unfortunately, whether we have need-blind or or any other institution of higher learning. need-aware admissions, these young people will not have the privilege of attending Brown ayIcopies MUNK, لجهم I am encouraged by Brown's creative engagement in the struggle. The Coalition of Essential Schools, one of the best known and most effective nationwide agents for constructive change in secondary education, was established by Prof. Theodore Sizer at Brown and continues to have its national headquarters here. It is a multimillion-dollar enterprise which has experienced extraordinary growth in the last few years. Hope High School and School One are two Providence schools which are involved in the Coalition's program. Two years ago, I announced the Providence Scholars Program, which set aside $2 million of financial aid endowment to provide funds for graduates of Providence public high schools. Our Champlin Fellows program, created in 1982, provides scholarShip funds for graduates of Rhode Island public schools who would not otherwise be able to attend Brown. We currently have 28 Champlin Fellows on campus. You Brown students also make a direct contribution. Some of our efforts may seem infinitesimally small compared to the magnitude of the nation's problem, but they are effective and will be continued: • Hundreds of Brown students, working through the Swearer Center for Public Service, fraternities, sororities, Brown Community Outreach, Big Brothers and Sisters and other organizations, regularly take time to work with Providence schoolchildren. I cannot exaggerate how important these interactions are, whether tutoring or simply taking an in-terest. The adoption of Fox Point School by Brown's athletic teams has made a big difference to the schoolchildren there. • Brown's recently announced MedAc program (for Access to Medical Careers) identifies minority students who have an interest in the life sciences as early as their middle school years. These students receive special tutoring, summer programs, mentoring, advising and other support from a consortium of institutions. Among other goals, MedAc hopes to increase the number of local minority students who pursue careers in life sciences at Brown and the Brown Medical School. After it is established in Providence, MedAc will become a national model. • Brown's admission officers, together with colleagues at Ivy League and other schools, are taking the lead in extending minority recruitment efforts into the ninth grade and earlier, where their efforts can have a much more significant impact. They will soon begin visiting middle schools in Hartford and Boston, not just to make a case for Brown, Yale or Smith, but to forcefully argue the case for staying in school and taking the kind of courses which will lead to college admission. In many high schools, unfor-tunately, presentations to juniors and seniors come too late; the educational system has already failed them. With the held of the Office of Alumni Relations, Brown's 4.700 Third World alumn have organized steering committees in eight cities. Their open houses, receptions and other efforts to interest minority high school srudents in attending Brown have helped increase the size of our minority applicant pool. These are joint efforts with Brown's National Alumni Schools Program (NASP), which has also been working to increase the participation and effectiveness of minority alumni in the recruiting and interviewing • Brown hosts special recruiting events for minorities. Last November, for example, our Admission Office brought 200 of the most promising black college prospects on the East Coast to campus for a weekend. More than half of those students applied, and I am told that half of those applicants are likely to be admitted. Financial aid and minority admissions are areas in which Brown University is making progress and intends to make more. They are not, however, the only areas which need ai-tention. Over the years, various groups have presented me with peations urging that tuition not be raised, that there be no layoffs during hard times, that the University supply health insurance in union contracts at no cost, that the library receive more support, that we hire more outstanding faculty, particularly minorities. None of the groups has identified a method by which Brown can afford to accomplish all these worthy goals. Next year, Brown will spend $19.2 million of its own money on undergraduate financial aid. This is twice as much as it will spend for the libraries and is about two-thirds of what Brown will spend on salaries for its faculty. It represents a commitment to financial aid which compares favorably with institutions that have far deeper financial resources. We must maintain the assets which define Brown, including our faculty and instructional pro-grams, for access to Brown is meaningful only if Brown remains a center of excellence. The privilege of attending Brown University is made possible by three factors: tuition, which supplies nearly three-quarters of our operating budget; the generosity of our alumni and friends through the Brown Annual Fund; and income generated by our endowment. We have chosen the endowment and the Brown Annual Fund as the focus of our efforts in the comprehensive campaign. As president, I have valued the unity of our community and its common ideals. Universities prize the fact that they are communities in which reason and discourse find solutions, where intimidation and dissension are never tools for progress. We must work to preserve and enhance our sense of common purpose. I believe the upcoming campaign will give us all the opportunity to unite and to work toward the solution of problems which I see as challenges and opportunities.",,Vartan Gregorian,Male,4/1/89,1095,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Looking Inward,1/1/87,12/31/92,Private non-religious,Providence,RI,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",60,"During the last month, a petition was circulated on campus asking that the director of financial aid, for whom a search is underway, be ""a qualified person of color."" On Tues-day, March 17, a group of students representing Students for Aid and Minority Admissions (SAMA), the Third World Coalition and the Undergraduate Council of Students visited my office and presented me that petition with the signatures of approximately 1,700 members of the Brown community. In addition, those students handed me an unsigned memorandum which made further comments along with five demands. Because I cannot respond individually to the 1,700 signers of the petition, I have decided to write to the entire University community so that the signers will receive my answer and others may read about the University's initiatives and priorities. First, let me correct some errors of fact. The petition asserts that minority enrollment ""is dropping at an alarming rate."" Minority enrollment is not dropping at all. Since my arrival at Brown there has been a steady increase in minority enrollments, from 24 to 26 percent. The petition also asserts that a director of financial aid who is a person of color could be a leader in ""reviving the administration's commitment to pluralism."" The administration's commitment is not in need of revival. It is robust and will continue so. As you may already know, there is a search committee for the director of financial aid position. It is chaired by Prof. James Wyche, associate provost for minority affairs. The committee includes faculty, staff and students and represents all segments of the Brown community, including minorities. Prof. Wyche has assured me that the search will be as broad as possible. I have full confidence in his leadership, ability and integrity. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the committee is aware of and sensitive to the concerns of all students, including minorities, and that it will act in the best interests of the University and its students. I have transmitted a copy of the petition to Prof. Wyche's committee. Brown University has long adhered to the principle of equal employment opportunity. William Baily, Brown's director of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action, and Beverly Ledbetter, vice president and general counsel, have confirmed that placing racial, ethnic, gender or other restrictions on a search of this kind would violate the spirit and letter of Brown's own policies and would be contrary to federal guidelines. I will not restrict the search as the petition requests. Our aim is to find and hire the best person for the job. Finally, the petition mentions a director of financial aid who is ""responsible to the student body."" The unsigned memo goes even further, demanding that the director be ""account- able"" directly to student groups, including the Third World Coalition, SOFA, SOA the UCS. The director of financial aid. whoever he or she is, will report to the dean responsible to the Brown Corporation and the Brown community. mission and financial aid, who renorts to the provost.

62,tft2,6/15/87,Tufts University,Demands of the Federal Government on the University which Inhibit its Ability to do Research,Remarks,Political CT,"I have been asked to talk about the demands of the Federal government on universities which hinder our ability to do research. Before I do so, I would like thank the National Institutes of Health for their sponsorship of the major part of my own research since 1950. I am proud to be part of a unique enterprise. Over the past 40 years, the support of the Federal government, and in particular, of the National Institutes of Health, has made the United States' overall research effort in the health sciences the finest, the most innovative, and the most productive in the world. However, it is always possible to do better, and in some areas, hindrances certainly do exist. I should say, also, that some of the things I will mention are not susceptible to change just through the actions of NIH- or of Universities. They will need cooperation from all of us, inside and outside the Federal government• Academic research, particularly in the biosciences, rather than being the ""ivory tower"", insular and detached undertaking still commonly associated by many with University life, is, in fact, a heavily regulated activity. Most of this regulation is imposed by the Federal Government. And while it is recognized by both the Federal Government and the Universities that the demands on Universities arising from these regulations and policies are substantial, burdensome and costly, I believe that both Government and Universities (even the exceptionally astute group in this room, underestimate the true costs. Of course, the Federal Government does usually create these regulations from whole cloth-the Congress usually responds to real or imagined public (or pressure group) concerns. More about this later. I have six basic points. I will begin with the broadest considerations, and end with the narrowest, but far from the least important from the viewpoint of continued research: Indirect Cost Recovery (ICR)-the bottom line. Research proposals-the ways in which they are judged, valued, and selected for funding. (I will point out later that regulations are increasing the costs of preparing proposals) • At NIH, peer review is the accepted, by and large, satisfactory, and, ostensibly, fairest way to fund individual research projects. The results show clearly that it has been a useful way to evaluate their merits. However, as we all know, peer review is not a perfect system. One obvious weakness is that new ideas may not be taken up. The White House Science Council, in its February 1986 report said, ""Indeed, the peer review system has, at times, been antagonistic toward creativity, and examples exist of truly creative and revolutionary research that has been conducted in recent years only in spite of obstacles inherent in the peer review process."" I think that reviewers may be particularly unlikely to fund innovative research if it is proposed by a new, young investigator without an eminent track record. This is especially true when the person comes from an institution which has not yet established a highly impressive reputation of its own • In addition, because of the focus of the Institutes, some proposals, even from established investigators, fall between stools. The proposals are bounced back and forth from one Institute to another, and, if the investigator is well known, the Council will decide. If the person is not well known, the proposal will probably be rejected simply because it falls in between the several Institutes' areas of competence. Finally, when we talk about indivilual grants and peer review, we are usually talking about proposals funded for three to five years. But some areas of investigation are deep enough to cover twenty years or more. For example, longitudinal studies of aging take twelve years in dogs or pigs, fifty in human beings. They are generally considered desirable, but as long as the Congress votes on the budget each year and is unwilling to obligate money for the long run, there is always uncertainty. Some of the areas are broad enough to cover a number of disciplines. I strongly suggest that NIH consider possible mechanisms to assure funding for such investigations. (This, incidentally, will help insure peer recognition for young investigators who participate in interdisciplinary research which falls in between the areas of competence of academic departments.) Beyond this, I have serious questions about the utility of peer review in some circumstances. I am talking about decisions to provide federal support for the construction of scientific research facilities, as opposed to decisions to fund individual research projects. No one denies that the United States Congress has the authority to direct where the research money it appropriates goes, but as the current controversy over direct Congressional support for research facilities demonstrates, many in the scientific community think that the Congress is not competent to make such decisions. I have to say that in this case, I believe that it is. While I yield to no one in my respect for scientists making judgements within the areas of their expertise, I simply do not think that decisions about the equitable geographic distribution of research resources, about the broadly-based provision of educational opportunity, about regional economic development, and about the strengthening of the nation's research infrastructure are within the specific competence of scientists. On the contrary, I believe that such decisions are within the competence and responsibility of Congress, and I am puzzled that so many of my colleagues in the scientific community have failed to grasp what appears to me to be this self-evident truth. averything else aside, it is surely short sighted and self-defeating to try to persuade the Congress to limit its authority in areas where the national well-being dictates otherwise. Peer review is not, and should not be, the only proper way to provide federal support for scientific research. 2. The types of research NIH is presently funding. It is possible to get support for international work, but not easy. There can be advantages to doing a study overseas. It may actually cost less: it can provide field training for graduate students, in some situations, the country- its climate, diet, and the like- offers a ready-made laboratory and an ideal study population. I suggest establishing an Overseas Study Section in NIH. And, on the subject of graduate students: There has been a substantial erosion in training grants and programs for pre-and post-doctoral students. The future depends on maintaining a strong scientific community- researchers, technologists, educators. It takes ten years to train a scientist. We need a continuous, dependable training program, with students always ""in the pipeline."" The problem is particularly acute for first-year graduate students, who must take courses full time and cannot earn their way as research fellows. Too many young people are turning away from science as a career because of this hurdle. 3. Flexibility in funding• It goes without saying, but is sometimes forgotten nevertheless, that the results of research are unknown when the research starts (or ought to be unknown). It can be that the most productive line of investigation will not be uncovered until after investigators have megun work on a study. Twenty to thirty years ago, grants were given with the written understanding that if the researcher uncovered a clearly more fruitful trail, he or she was free to use the funding to follow that eather then the original protocol, and that the agency would consider the matter at renewal time. In the 70's, grants became almost as rigia as contracts, as increasing attention to fiscal accountability began to restrict program flexibility. The function of research is to find new information. If peer review process works, questions will be asked at the review, so control is not lost. We need more flexibility, and, while I realize that the auditors, not the agency, are the responsible parties, perhaps we all can work to put more flexibility into the system. I also realize that the auditors and regulators are faced with a major change in the public perception of science. Everyone has benefitted over the years from the discoveries of health research; but everyone now also wishes to be protected from what are at least perceived as much higher risks- in genetic research, biohazards, and the like. And no one is doing public education in this vital area. 4. This leads to other points, specifically involving faculty investigators. Most of all, I would suggest that in responding to the demands of Federal regulations, both the Government and the Universities are placing an inordinate and inappropriate burden on our most important resources, the time and effort of our faculties. As a result we are getting less for our research in terms of productivity and, perhaps, that elusive commodity, creativity. Faculty participation on IRB's, Animal Care and Use Committees, Institutional Biosafety Committees and the like is incredibly time consuming and energy draining. Issues confronting these committees are substantial and I am constantly amazed at the seriousness and dedication faculty demonstrate once they reluctantly agree to serve. It takes a long time to become a knowlegeable and effective Committee member in these areas, and to become a Committee Chair requires expertise and management skills. University administrators are reluctant to rotate committee membership because of the difficulty in constantly breaking in new members. To be effective, committee tenure should be substantial. To be fair, committee tenure should be modest. It is very difficult to be both effective and fair under current ground rules. Committees often become focal points of controversy between faculty committee members and faculty investigators. This has to be time consuming and energy draining for all involved. Time spent by faculty in these committees and administering their individual research programs is hardly, in my opinion, ""quality"" time. Furthermore, I am concerned that aside from the time lost to more important activity, the frustration, contention and anxiety generated dampen the spark of creativity and enthusiasm that is essential not only to the School but to the nation as a whole. The rules as they relate to health, safety, and the ethical performance of research have been a good step, but in placing such heavy demands on faculty, I think we may be wasting a valuable asset needlessly and we should be looking at ways to improve the situation. First, more and more institutions are employing ""expert"" staff assistance to the various Committees. Despite their own protestations, all faculty do not come prepackaged with expertise in ethics, animal welfare, industrial hygiene and the like. The use of administrative review of all but the most unusual protocols should be seriously considered by both Federal agencies and Universities. For Federal agencies, this means changes in wattons and a willingness to recognize increased costs incurred by versities. For better or worse, faculty committee participation is often vered as a freebie but the addition of staff means dollars added to the bottom line. The true indirect cost of doing research must be recognized if direct dollars are to be used efficiently. Absent major changes in grant accountability policies, most investigators and institutions need professional help at the academic department level. Investigators are not accountants or auditors. Most institutions have markedly strengthened central grant accounting and research administration staffs. We have found the need to substantially upgrade administrative support at the Department level. Not so many years ago, academic departments functioned with a single department secretary. Now, with grant budgets often exceeding hard money budgets, our departments require an M.B.A. or the equivalent to serve as administrative manager. At the same time, Department Administration costs are being removed from our indirect cost pools. Increased flexibility such as that being investigated in the ""Florida Project"" would decrease the faculty burdens. But I think the use of less expensive, but administratively skilled support staff at all levels of the University is needed. In addition to increased use of staff to free up faculty from administrative chores, increased and improved education of the general faculty concerning these issues may be helpful. Conventional research training programs do not deal with research regulatory issues. Most researchers learn by doing and for some it is a long and painful process. A number of organizations provide educational programs and forums for discussion. But, as a rule, these are directed to and attended by research administrators and an occasional, highly motivated, faculty committee member. culations and a willingness to recognize increased costs incurred by niversities.

But, as a rule, these are directed to and attended by research administrators and an occasional, highly motivated, faculty committee member. sonal and regional meetings conduced by N.I.H. offices such as the fice for Protection from Research Risks (0.P.R.R.), primarily attract the administrator community. A better job needs to be done at the faculty level. I would suggest that the Director consider charging O.P.P.R., the Office of Extramural Research and Training, and any other appropriate N. I.H. group with investigating new approaches to educate researchers in research regulatory affairs. Sufficient support to develop pilot or model programs would be required. One approach might be to introduce a research administration curriculum in predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs not unlike finanical and regulatory affairs material included in current medical school curricula. Continuing education of existing faculty is a more difficult problem but I am sure there are good ideas in many of our premier research institutions which could be developed and shared with modest grant support. You will note that I have not dwelt here on trying to markedly change or retract existing regulations. I think those possibilities are remote. My purpose is to focus on the issue of poor utilization of faculty resources and ways of making faculty participation less onerous and more efficient. 5. Animal research: Apart from the growing realization among researchers that the use of animals in research involves far more complex and difficult decisions involving sentience and cognition than had been thought even ten years ago, the simple facts are that the regulatory standards and therefore the costs of animal care, research protocols, and research reporting are rising all the time. They should. But NIH is picking up only part of the expense. This leaves many institutions in a serious bind. Some may either find themselves in violation of regulations or forced to abandon research that involves animals altogether. suggest that NIH put itself out in front on these issues. First, by ding the improvement of animal facilities, second by urging Congress to commit even more funding to programs to develop viable alternatives to animal testing, for academic as well as commercial purposes, and, third, by defining and creating impeccable care and housing for animals still essential in some studies- of AIDS, for example- so that they can exist as nearly as possible in a habitat more similar to their natural environment. 6. My last point has to do with ICR. While I realize that these regulations are not under the direct control of NIH, they have necessitated a cumbersome administrative system, which is difficult for understaffed institutions, by which I mean both NIH and the universities, to administer. ICR should be negotiated and settled in a timely fashion. The reality, due to delays on the part of universities as well as NIH, is that many institutions are using provisional rates that are several years old. (Incidentally, the requirement to put ICR rates on the grant form, as some other agencies have done, may inject bias against schools with higher rates into the process of peer review. This has happened, and it can jeopardize the choice of projects purely on their scientific merits.) The Florida system experiment provides more flexible accounting mechanisms - in a sense, this, too, is going back to the situation as it existed twenty or thirty years ago- and this relaxation of some of the cumbersome rules that make grant administration difficult for all parties may be the way to go. Let me end by repeating what I said in the beginning. For all the hindrances, NIH is a good agency to work",,Jean Mayer,Male,7/1/76,4001,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Looking Inward,1/1/87,12/31/92,Private non-religious,Medford,MA,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",62,"I have been asked to talk about the demands of the Federal government on universities which hinder our ability to do research.

Absent major changes in grant accountability policies, most investigators and institutions need professional help at the academic department level. Investigators are not accountants or auditors. Most institutions have markedly strengthened central grant accounting and research administration staffs. We have found the need to substantially upgrade administrative support at the Department level. Not so many years ago, academic departments functioned with a single department secretary. Now, with grant budgets often exceeding hard money budgets, our departments require an M.B.A. or the equivalent to serve as administrative manager. At the same time, Department Administration costs are being removed from our indirect cost pools. Increased flexibility such as that being investigated in the ""Florida Project"" would decrease the faculty burdens. But I think the use of less expensive, but administratively skilled support staff at all levels of the University is needed. In addition to increased use of staff to free up faculty from administrative chores, increased and improved education of the general faculty concerning these issues may be helpful. Conventional research training programs do not deal with research regulatory issues. Most researchers learn by doing and for some it is a long and painful process.

A better job needs to be done at the faculty level. I would suggest that the Director consider charging O.P.P.R., the Office of Extramural Research and Training, and any other appropriate N. I.H. group with investigating new approaches to educate researchers in research regulatory affairs. Sufficient support to develop pilot or model programs would be required. One approach might be to introduce a research administration curriculum in predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs not unlike finanical and regulatory affairs material included in current medical school curricula. Continuing education of existing faculty is a more difficult problem but I am sure there are good ideas in many of our premier research institutions which could be developed and shared with modest grant support. You will note that I have not dwelt here on trying to markedly change or retract existing regulations. I think those possibilities are remote. My purpose is to focus on the issue of poor utilization of faculty resources and ways of making faculty participation less onerous and more efficient. 5. Animal research: Apart from the growing realization among researchers that the use of animals in research involves far more complex and difficult decisions involving sentience and cognition than had been thought even ten years ago, the simple facts are that the regulatory standards and therefore the costs of animal care, research protocols, and research reporting are rising all the time. They should. But NIH is picking up only part of the expense. This leaves many institutions in a serious bind. Some may either find themselves in violation of regulations or forced to abandon research that involves animals altogether. suggest that NIH put itself out in front on these issues. First, by ding the improvement of animal facilities, second by urging Congress to commit even more funding to programs to develop viable alternatives to animal testing, for academic as well as commercial purposes, and, third, by defining and creating impeccable care and housing for animals still essential in some studies- of AIDS, for example- so that they can exist as nearly as possible in a habitat more similar to their natural environment. 6. My last point has to do with ICR. While I realize that these regulations are not under the direct control of NIH, they have necessitated a cumbersome administrative system, which is difficult for understaffed institutions, by which I mean both NIH and the universities, to administer. ICR should be negotiated and settled in a timely fashion. The reality, due to delays on the part of universities as well as NIH, is that many institutions are using provisional rates that are several years old. (Incidentally, the requirement to put ICR rates on the grant form, as some other agencies have done, may inject bias against schools with higher rates into the process of peer review. This has happened, and it can jeopardize the choice of projects purely on their scientific merits.) The Florida system experiment provides more flexible accounting mechanisms - in a sense, this, too, is going back to the situation as it existed twenty or thirty years ago- and this relaxation of some of the cumbersome rules that make grant administration difficult for all parties may be the way to go. Let me end by repeating what I said in the beginning. For all the hindrances, NIH is a good agency to work",2918,0.010473235,0.003491078,0.003491078,0.002715283,0.237005431,0.022885958,0.004266874,0.015128006,0.004266874,0.006594259,0.581458495,0.004266874,0.008145849,0.006594259,0.012024825,0.031419705,0.012024825,0.013576416,0.012024825,0.008145849,0.065554694,0.019782777,0.043444531,0.871217998,6/15/87,"Looking

63,tft3,11/3/90,Tufts University,Annual Report of the President to the Board of Trustees,Message,Campus CT,"While 1990 signaled the beginning of a new decade for all of us, for higher education, and Tufts in particular, many developments in the last six to twelve months are being seen as markers for the issues that will challenge higher education into the twenty-first century. But events in arenas other than academia gave rise to these concerns. In the following paragraphs, I will touch on some of these issues, most of which challenge the accountability of higher education in several areas. Accountability Academe has been engaged in extensive soul-searching specifically on the issue of accountability in the recent past: simply put, is a viable product being delivered? The debate is ongoing in the academic press, journals of higher education, and the daily press. While academics and journalists offer their assessments of the ""plight"" of higher education, it must be acknowledged that healthy self-examination is integral to most institutions of higher education and it is behind most planning that takes place in higher education. This is especially true within the various schools of Tufts as my following discussion bears out. Declining Applicant Pool We are seeing an accelerating decline in the national applicant pool which is prompting most private institutions to put their best foot forward in order to attract and maintain their preferred applicant base from which to choose an entering class. (Happy exceptions to this are experienced in some of our graduate schools: the Sackler School of Biomedical Sciences, the School of Dental Medicine, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences saw an increase in the total number of applications for admission.) However, parents are turning from highly ranked but expensive private institutions to state institutions for their sons and daughters because of the current economic slowdown and subsequent shift in federal and state financial aid eligibility criteria that exclude their children. Letters from parents of accepted students have quoted the same financial considerations as their reason for turning down a Tufts education for their children. An admissions brochure highlighting competitive advantages of each Tufts school is planned and, it is hoped, that in detailing our excellence and uniqueness, no change in Tufts' strong attraction to the best and brightest will be experienced. This compelling statement of the benefits of a Tufts education will not only enhance Tufts' already desirable rating, but could also serve to attract those students who are on the margins of today's tight economic picture. It has been Tufts' commitment to excellence over the last fourteen years, however, and not the specter of a declining applicant base, that has inspired and continues to inspire change and innovation at all Tufts' schools. Diversity At a time when diversity is being stressed, finding diversity among undergraduate aspirants as well as prospective faculty is becoming more difficult due to the shrinking numbers of qualified and qualifying minorities. Tufts' faculty and students lobby increasingly for more minorities on campus in spite of this trend. This decline in the ethnic diversity has also been felt on the graduate level. This is apparent among the student body at schools such as Sackler and certainly among the faculty of the other health sciences schools. Many factors in our society have worked to create these shortages, but academe must, nonetheless, deal with the consequences and the demands from faculty and students for greater minority representation among their ranks. An ad hoc faculty committee will be meeting in the following months to pursue ways to increase racial and ethnic diversity among the arts and sciences faculty at Tufts. Likewise, on the Boston campus a committee has been formed at the medical school to address the issue of minority faculty. Specifically, although Asian students and faculty are represented on the Boston campus, the number of African-Americans is underrepresented. University-wide, all faculty search committees have been charged to seek actively women and minority candidates, and as a result, arts and sciences was able, after long and exhaustive searches, to appoint two women in biology and two in engineering. Also, offers were extended to two minority candidates for positions in sociology, but they were refused. Significantly, we have made headway in the last decade in the number of women and minority faculty members hired and also those who have tenure or are on a tenure track. In 1980 the Faculty of Arts and Sciences counted seventy-one women in their ranks, of whom only thirty-one were tenured or on a tenure track. Today, although women faculty number only seventy-eight, fifty-five are tenured or tenure tracked. Only fifteen faculty of color were listed with only three having tenure in 1980. This past year forty-one faculty of color could be found among the arts and sciences teaching staff with thirty-one of them being tenured or tenure tracked. Diminishing Public Support Beyond academia, discontent among voters on a local, state, and national level is threatening government funding of public programs not only in human services, but to all sectors of education as well. As an example, our own veterinary school successfully survived the threat of serious state budget cuts that would have closed another similar, more underfunded, younger school. In spite of this difficult situation, the university as a whole (and most of the other schools individually) continued to function within the well-defined parameters of their budgets. Our fiscal management has paid off in another way. The effort over the last three years by Central Administration to reduce costs has proven a sound defense against the recent unstable state fiscal picture. In fact, we dipped into our reserves less this year (roughly half of the amount used last year) and we saw the medical and dental schools coming close to a break-even level. Deans have had to be resourceful in order to save some of their programs. For instance, the funding of the dental school's Fernald Program which provides dental care for clients of the state's facilities for the handicapped was salvaged for Tufts only after long negotiations with state agencies. The Chelsea Soldiers'® Home Dental Program, hitherto a state program, was reorganized as a school project with partial support from the state and a moderate fee charged to patients. Educational institutions in Massachusetts are monitoring closely a referendum on the November state ballot that could force yet greater budget cuts and consequently threaten further the operating budgets of many Massachusetts colleges and universities, including ours. As I noted in my 1990 Baccalaureate address, everyone wants services, but no one is willing to pay for them. Such large scale abrogation of government responsibility for services can be counterbalanced only through volunteerism. Thus, the need to guide our students into becoming citizens with a strong sense of moral responsibility to their community iS, perhaps, one of our most compelling mandates. Of course, volunteerism has long been an important mission of students at Tufts and they have been encouraged in their efforts by the faculty and administration. Some of the formally organized groups on campus are: the United Jewish Appeal at Hillel, the Catholic Center, which continued its volunteer program with developmentally-disabled young people through St. Clement's Parish in Somerville, and the Leonard Carmichael Society. Membership in the Leonard Carmichael Society, while still hovering around 10 percent of the undergraduate student body, is significantly larger than three years ago when only thirty students belonged. An advisory board of faculty and upperclassmen was appointed last year which has provided important direction and advice to the LCS volunteers. This student-run volunteer organization is adding to its programming, and direct crisis management efforts such as feeding the homeless and closer ties to Somerville human service organizations will be pursued. Many less formally constituted groups have made service to the community a priority, such as the students living in the Start House at the Asian American Center who spend time volunteering in Boston's Chinatown, while groups organized for other reasons, such as the Greek organizations on campus, are also showing a growing awareness of and interest in community service. A delayed enrollment option available to freshmen who would devote a year to public service as volunteers in the U.S. or abroad has been instituted at Tufts this year and guarantees students a place in the following year. Although not widely advertised, five accepted students have nonetheless chosen this option. Ultimately, upwards of fifty students could pursue this community service option. Eighteen Tufts graduates from the class of 1990, more than from any other institution, were selected to belong to the five hundred Teach For America volunteers who will be trained to provide much-needed support in urban schools across the nation in the next year. A Tufts faculty member is involved in the training of these volunteers. The selection of such a large number of volunteers from Tufts, in my opinion, eloquently recognizes the fact that we are educating a corps of concerned citizens who will bring to social problems of our society. whatever they undertake in life, insight and compassion for the diverse Higher education, especially in the New England area, has been the unfortunate target of a Justice Department investigation of alleged rate setting at fifty-five colleges and universities, while a congressional committee looking into scientific fraud has implicated a number of U.S. institutions receiving National Institutes of Health awards. The former stands to cost some universities close to a half million dollars in legal fees while Tufts has so far spent over $100,000 for that purpose. The latter investigation names a researcher now on our staff who must defend her research done while at another institution. Yet, this, too, has involved considerable time and expense for Tufts. We are monitoring closely some recent attacks on the current practice of earmarking funds for research from the National Science Foundation which would seriously limit Tufts' ability to compete for federal research money. Finally, the local business community is watching several segments of the labor force not traditionally part of a union which are now investigating the possibility of unionization. Tufts, like other universities, is actively pursuing methods of meeting the needs of these labor groups. Curriculum Criticism of the adequacy of curricula to prepare students for the fast-evolving world economic and political arenas abounds in the press. Our emphasis on learning a second language answers one of the criticisms of proponents of curriculum reform and prepares our students for life in a shrinking world. This, incidentally, contributed greatly toward our being selected by the Olin Foundation as recipient of a building for the language arts now halfway completed. Curricula should be global in orientation, the critics say. I commented on the well-established global perspectives of our schools in my 1988 annual report. In addition to the many interdisciplinary and inter-school programs discussed therein, notably those involving the Fletcher School, which make our schools exciting and challenging places to learn, we have, this past year, pursued other avenues and have designed new programs to insure curricula responsive to society's needs. Through joint programs and dual appointments we have strengthened arts and sciences as well as the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. A combined degree program to promote the D.V.M/Ph.D. is being worked out with the veterinary school and plans are underway to design a graduate program housed on the Grafton campus. A combined Ph.D. program in food and nutrition planning in developing countries between the School of Nutrition and the Fletcher School (our two most ""international"" schools) has been very successful. In the College of Engineering the lechnology Centers supplement the department structure within the college by providing interdisciplinary bridges within the colleges and with the various schools of the university. These centers are interactive with industry. The College of Engineering also provides an interdisciplinary curriculum, especially through the combining of its disparate Materials Science and Engineering programs in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering into a single administrative unit called the Laboratory for Materials and Interfaces (LMI) under the auspices of the Department of Chemical Engineering. The relocation of chemical engineering to the new Science and Technology Center at 4 Colby Street places the four most active materials research groups of the College of Engineering and the College of Liberal Arts in the same building for the first time and as a result should promote increased interdisciplinary interaction and many new joint projects with that happy combination of creativity and usefulness. Two new interdisciplinary degree programs were created in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences: the dual master degree between the Fletcher School and the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy, and the Interdisciplinary Doctorate. The College of Liberal Arts and the medical school have cooperatively designed a B.A./M.D. Early Notification Program. Two NIH training grants will involve close interaction between the School of Nutrition and the Human Nutrition Research Center. One will fund a program for physicians interested in clinical nutrition training, while the other will fund fellowships for pre-doctoral science students. HNRC will add a new dimension to the relevancy of its curriculum for students and to the validity of its research through coalitions with other similar institutions, both here and abroad, that it is pursuing These are but some examples of how curricula at Tufts are constantly reviewed, revised, and interconnected enabling us to provide an education that meets the challenges of our fast-evolving, technology-based market-place, while insuring that our schools avoid the trap of becoming, as one Research and publishing interests. Specialization Versus Spirituality In response to the criticism that in the quest to be on the cutting edge of scientific technology, higher education neglects its mandate to nourish the spirit and shape the moral behavior of its students, I can, with confidence, reiterate Tufts' already strong stand on ethics in all schools of the university which was discussed in detail in my annual report last year. In recent months many institutions of higher education have begun to recognize the need to take a stand on ethics. Tufts took a look at its ethical underpinnings last year, through discussions at University Council, and found that besides the encompassing ethical guidelines of our health sciences schools, where interaction with patients is so sensitive, students in all schools, on all levels of learning are exposed to spiritual and philosophical ideologies, as well as a socially-acceptable ethical code of conduct, through formal courses, and admonition and example of their faculty, their advisers and mentors, and their religious leaders. Our chaplain, Reverend McLennan, has been editing the presentations on ethics made by the school deans to the University Council last year. His report will be published as a special supplement to the Criterion in the fall and mailed to all trustees. Tufts' Hillel was chosen as recipient of a grant from the Jacobs Burns Endowment in Ethics of the B'Nai B'rith Hillel Foundations. Under the grant, a half-day forum on ""Ethics and the University Community"" was held in April, cosponsored by the University Chaplaincy and the Catholic Center. Finally, we hope that not only through ethical standards but by our strong emphasis on extra-curricular participation in the arts, participatory sports, and community service the majority of our students will leave Tufts with a strong and positive appreciation of much that is spiritually refreshing and morally supportive. Many of the top research institutions are only now beginning to reexamine their emphasis on research and how it has affected the liberal arts curriculum. Tied up with their exploration is the question of criteria for tenure and promotion of faculty. Over the last few years, we have been examining the balance between research, teaching, and advising how that could change our requirements for tenure. The discussion will continue and will certainly be a major concern of the person selected to fill the position of academic vice president of arts, sciences, and technology. But the oft-heard complaint that faculty are too busy pursuing research money to teach and counsel students should not in fairness be pinned on Tufts. True, research at Tufts has grown exponentially in the last decade but only because the base was so small. On the Hill campus, devotion to rigorous academic requirements and student advising has served to insure a fine liberal arts education. Although we are putting considerable effort into teaching ethical behavior, it is becoming popular in our society to protest the recognition newly accorded certain non-mainstream groups. Not surprisingly then, issues of freedom of speech and freedom of religion in the undergraduate community dominated much of the educational and programming activities of the university chaplains in the past year. logether with the dean of students' office, the chaplains have concentrated on clarifying the university's viewpoint that freedom of speech must also go along with freedom from harassment. This issue surfaced a year ago, but a more egregious event this year that violated a group's right to worship demanded a firmer response from the university. After meeting with the chaplains, I issued a statement that specifically addressed this infraction and made it clear that interference with freedom of worship would not be tolerated at Tufts. The chaplains and the dean of students are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the students that seeks to distinguish their right to free speech from malicious and intentional harassment of an individual or a group. I feel confident that our attempts to encourage greater tolerance and understanding may one day prove effective in dulling the reactionary bullying we see today.",,Jean Mayer,Male,7/1/76,5238,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Looking Inward,1/1/87,12/31/92,Private non-religious,Medford,MA,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",63,"While 1990 signaled the beginning of a new decade for all of us, for higher education, and Tufts in particular, many developments in the last six to twelve months are being seen as markers for the issues that will challenge higher education into the twenty-first century.

Tufts took a look at its ethical underpinnings last year, through discussions at University Council, and found that besides the encompassing ethical guidelines of our health sciences schools, where interaction with patients is so sensitive, students in all schools, on all levels of learning are exposed to spiritual and philosophical ideologies, as well as a socially-acceptable ethical code of conduct, through formal courses, and admonition and example of their faculty, their advisers and mentors, and their religious leaders. Our chaplain, Reverend McLennan, has been editing the presentations on ethics made by the school deans to the University Council last year. His report will be published as a special supplement to the Criterion in the fall and mailed to all trustees. Tufts' Hillel was chosen as recipient of a grant from the Jacobs Burns Endowment in Ethics of the B'Nai B'rith Hillel Foundations. Under the grant, a half-day forum on ""Ethics and the University Community"" was held in April, cosponsored by the University Chaplaincy and the Catholic Center. Finally, we hope that not only through ethical standards but by our strong emphasis on extra-curricular participation in the arts, participatory sports, and community service the majority of our students will leave Tufts with a strong and positive appreciation of much that is spiritually refreshing and morally supportive. Many of the top research institutions are only now beginning to reexamine their emphasis on research and how it has affected the liberal arts curriculum. Tied up with their exploration is the question of criteria for tenure and promotion of faculty. Over the last few years, we have been examining the balance between research, teaching, and advising how that could change our requirements for tenure. The discussion will continue and will certainly be a major concern of the person selected to fill the position of academic vice president of arts, sciences, and technology. But the oft-heard complaint that faculty are too busy pursuing research money to teach and counsel students should not in fairness be pinned on Tufts. True, research at Tufts has grown exponentially in the last decade but only because the base was so small. On the Hill campus, devotion to rigorous academic requirements and student advising has served to insure a fine liberal arts education. Although we are putting considerable effort into teaching ethical behavior, it is becoming popular in our society to protest the recognition newly accorded certain non-mainstream groups. Not surprisingly then, issues of freedom of speech and freedom of religion in the undergraduate community dominated much of the educational and programming activities of the university chaplains in the past year. logether with the dean of students' office, the chaplains have concentrated on clarifying the university's viewpoint that freedom of speech must also go along with freedom from harassment. This issue surfaced a year ago, but a more egregious event this year that violated a group's right to worship demanded a firmer response from the university. After meeting with the chaplains, I issued a statement that specifically addressed this infraction and made it clear that interference with freedom of worship would not be tolerated at Tufts. The chaplains and the dean of students are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the students that seeks to distinguish their right to free speech from malicious and intentional harassment of an individual or a group. I feel confident that our attempts to encourage greater tolerance and understanding may one day prove effective in dulling the reactionary bullying we see today.",2936,0.01332853,0.014048991,0.003962536,0.022694524,0.166066282,0.057276657,0.004682997,0.028458213,0.418948127,0.029899135,0.066642651,0.006123919,0.047910663,0.009726225,0.024855908,0.030619597,0.028458213,0.009726225,0.014769452,0.001801153,0.077449568,0.053674352,0.074207493,0.794668588,11/3/90,"Looking

65,tft5,10/7/90,Tufts University,Report and Declaration of the Presidents Conference,Message,Political CT,"Twenty-two presidents, rectors, and vice chancellors of universities from all over the world convened at the Tufts European Center in Talloires, France from October 4-7, 1990 to discuss the role of universities and, in particular, the role of university presidents in environmental management and sustainable development. Assisted by internationally respected environmental leaders, the presidents explored the state of the natural environment, the impact of human population growth and economic activity on the environment, and strategies for the future. The presidents discussed the role of education, research, policy formation, and information exchange in managing human impact on the environment. Since the majority of the presidents were from developing countries, concerns about resource depletion, poverty, and the need for substantial assistance from developed countries received equal attention with local, regional, and global pollution problems. The conference was organized and hosted by Tufts University President Jean Mayer and sponsored by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. After a keynote address by Maurice Strong, secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (to be held in Brazil in June 1992), the presidents developed a series of recommendations which are summarized in this report. The conference ended with a declaration of actions to be taken by the participants. The presidents believe this conference is an important first step in engaging the considerable resources of universities to work toward an environmentally sustainable future. They pledge mutual support as they take actions at their own universities to implement the recommendations. They hope their deliberations will encourage other university leaders to initiate programs to prepare their graduates for the challenges of the twenty-first century. They invite their colleagues to sign the declaration and join them in these efforts. FINDINGS State of the World For the first time in world history the human species is drastically altering the face of the earth and the composition of its atmosphere. Global air and water pollution, accumulation of toxic wastes, destruction of forests, and depletion of the ozone layer threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species. The integrity of the earth, its biodiversity, and the security of nations are at risk. These environmental changes are caused by inequitable and unsustainable production and consumption patterns which also aggravate poverty in many regions of the world. Moreover, these trends are likely to worsen in the absence of societal intervention. The U.N. World Commission on Environment and Development predicts world population will double and economic output will increase four- to fivefold in the next forty to fifty years. Urgent actions by all sectors of society – government, business and industry, private foundations, educational institutions, citizen groups, and the general public are needed to address these fundamental problems and reverse the trends. Stabilization of human population, adoption of environmentally sound industrial and agricultural technologies, reforestation, and ecological restoration are crucial to create an equitable and sustainable future for all humankind in harmony with nature. Role of Universities Universities educate most of the people who develop and manage society’s institutions. For this reason, universities bear profound responsibilities to increase the awareness, knowledge, technologies, and tools to create an environmentally sustainable future. Universities have all the expertise necessary to develop the intellectual and conceptual framework to achieve this goal. Universities must play a strong role in the education, research, policy development, information exchange, and community outreach to help create an equitable and sustainable future. Education and Training There is a critical shortage of specialists in environmental management and related fields. Universities must produce environmentally literate specialists in demography, engineering, science, economics, social sciences, health, and management, particularly for developing countries. A huge gap exists in the comprehension by professionals in all fields of how their actions affect the environment and public health. These professionals and other university graduates must be educated to be environmentally literate and responsible citizens. Primary and secondary school teachers must also spread environmental awareness, literacy, and responsibility among their students. Practicing professionals, decision-makers at major institutions, and the general public must be given the training, expertise, and tools to encourage environmentally sustainable actions. Research and Policy Formation Research on the complex interaction of human activities and the environment – examining strategies, technologies, policies, and institutional behavior – must be greatly expanded.Universities must lead the effort in the rapid development of environmentally sound technologies and the establishment of a new ethos to stabilize population, promote the efficient and sustainable use of energy, water, and other natural resources, repair damage, and prevent pollution and wastes. Universities must increase anticipatory research to identify future threats to a sustainable society, and develop solutions to circumvent these threats. Research on how the different types and levels of economic development among the nations of the world impact the environment is critical to government and industry policy formation. International cooperation between developed and developing countries is necessary for environmentally sustainable development strategies. An open flow of information among all universities around the world and, in particular, in developing countries, is crucial to the development of new knowledge, technology, tools, and skills for a sustainable future. The University as a Role Model The university is a microcosm of the larger community, and the manner in which it carries out its daily activities is an important demonstration of ways to achieve environmentally responsible living. By practicing what it preaches, the university can both engage the students in understanding the institutional metabolism of materials and activities, and have them actively participate to minimize pollution and waste. The Role of University Presidents Understanding the relationship between population, human activities, and the environment, and developing strategies for an environmentally sustainable future are among the most complex issues with which society must deal. Because universities are organized into specialized areas of knowledge and traditional disciplines, it is often difficult to convene the necessary talent for teaching and research on these issues. For example, earth science is approached as if the world is a collection of separate biological and physical systems instead of treating the biosphere as a fully integrated functioning life system. Tenure, curriculum, and degree requirements are largely controlled by faculty in individual schools of study. Quality scholarship is often synonymous with originality in a single discipline, and individual contribution is generally encouraged over team efforts. University presidents often have a broad perspective on global problems, but have limited say in academic direction. However, university presidents are the only academic leaders capable of converging all the academic disciplines and professional schools on large, complex issues. University presidents must focus their schools’ attention on the critical issues by speaking out, acquiring new and mobilizing existing resources, creating incentives and programs for faculty development, and fostering interest in these issues. RECOMMENDATIONS University presidents must take action to focus university attention on environment, population, and development issues. They should: 1. Use every opportunity to raise public, government, foundation, and university awareness by publicly speaking out on the importance of environmental concerns. 2. Seek large increases in the funding of interdisciplinary, environmental research. Research funds are often earmarked for traditional disciplines, resulting in the continuing compartmentalization of problems and solutions. The funding available for research on population, environment, and sustainable development is a tiny fraction of that available for basic science, defense, and aerospace. 3. Encourage outstanding scholars who engage in research and teaching on environmental topics, and help them lead other scholars in this direction. 4. Establish programs in all major disciplines to teach about environment, population, and sustainable development in the context of these disciplines. 5. Work with faculty to change tenure and promotion requirements to reward interdisciplinary work on environment, population, and sustainable development issues. 6. Set aside funding and create positions for interdepartmental and interschool faculty who will research and teach population, environment, and sustainable development topics. 7. Appoint a special adviser, an environmental programs dean, or faculty group to promote environmental programs within the university. 8. Encourage multidisciplinary thinking with the use of internships, capstone and integrating seminars, work study, and case studies. 9. Establish a university environmental policy to engage faculty, staff, administration, and students in activities such as energy and water conservation, and recycling. Encourage vendors who supply schools with products and services to act in an environmentally responsible manner when manufacturing their products and delivering their services. 10. Develop cooperative programs with universities in other countries to promote faculty and student exchanges, collaborative research, and education programs that develop international understanding. 11. Establish multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary structures, such as “centers of excellence” for research, education, and policy development within the university. 12. Establish partnerships with primary and secondary schools to enhance the capability of their faculty in teaching about population, environment, and sustainable development issues. CONTINUING MOMENTUM The presidents decided that these first steps must be expanded to other universities if the world is to move down a more environmentally sustainable path. Furthermore, they wished to establish a mechanism to inform and support each other’s efforts in these new directions. Accordingly, they agreed to form a steering committee of university presidents representing all regions of the world to continue and expand these efforts. The secretariat for the group will be established at Tufts University. The steering committee and its secretariat will carry out the following activities: 1. Convene school deans and environmental practitioners to advance university research, education, and policy development. 2. Explore opportunities for joint education and research projects. 3. Exchange information on programs and strategies to have more active university involvement in population, environment, and development research and education. 4. Work on expanding the involvement of government, industry, and foundations in supporting university efforts in these areas. 5. Work with the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development to promote a worldwide university effort toward a sustainable future.",,Jean Mayer,Male,7/1/76,5211,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Looking Inward,1/1/87,12/31/92,Private non-religious,Medford,MA,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",65,"Twenty-two presidents, rectors, and vice chancellors of universities from all over the world convened at the Tufts European Center in Talloires, France from October 4-7, 1990 to discuss the role of universities and, in particular, the role of university presidents in environmental management and sustainable development.

66,tft6,11/2/91,Tufts University,Annual Report of the President to the Board of Trustees,Message,Campus CT,"It is probably true that the lack of interest in running for the senate is a sign not of indifference but of satisfaction with things as they are. Only five members of the class of 1993 stood as candidates for the seven senate seats representing their class, thus the two unfilled seats were filled by students from the class of 1995. A new housing program begins in the fall called Bridge/Metcalf. This is a pilot program that it is hoped will be instituted in all dorms. The goals of the program are to create opportunities for students to bridge academic and nonacademic life, to enhance intellectual life and personal development, to increase informal, out-of-classroom contact with faculty, and to build a sense of community in residential living by expanding the range of shared activities. For a large number of students, the recession has actually brought about a pleasant change in lifestyle because of a surplus of affordable apartments. Many more eligible students chose to live off-campus and as a result, a decline in demand for dorm rooms coupled with a tight cap on enrollments at first led to the decision to close Miller Hall in the fall for renovations. However, a late and unexpected demand for dormitory rooms in September obviated the need to close Miller Hall. Had Miller closed it would not have meant a financial burden on the budget since the additional income from the large new dorm, South Hall, would offset any revenue lost. The surplus of on-campus dormitory rooms last year allowed many GSAS students together with a few graduate students from the Health Sciences schools to take advantage of on-campus housing. About fifty beds in Bush and Haskell halls were filled by graduate students. This worked so well that the same students petitioned the university to allow them the same access this year. For the 1992-1993 academic year at least eighty-nine beds will be made available for graduate students in locations near Medford Hillside. The presence of graduate students on campus has some definite advantages. It is felt by deans and administrators alike that this added dimension of diversity to campus living is indeed desirable and to be encouraged. The opportunity arose rather unexpectedly and it is perhaps too soon to evaluate the benefits to be derived from the presence of graduate students on campus or to decide how to make the most of it. A student resolution on ROTC was presented to the administra-tion. Many students object to the DOD policy of discrimination against gay men and women and bisexuals and asked the university to get out. At this point, the administration has no desire to comply but there was a feeling of the need to give DOD a clear view of the position of the university which is that exclusion of gays and bisexuals from military service is obsolete. In the spring, M.I.T. called together representatives from Boston area colleges with ROTC students to consider a response to DOD. This committee continues to meet and plan a formal action. Admissions Institutions of higher education are ranked by many factors. One factor is the number of applications to its schools and the demand for available places in each class. Student applications at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy rose another 11 percent this year, following annual increases for the last five years, as the school's reputation gains greater worldwide renown. Applications at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences increased 3.3 percent. A dramatic 35 percent increase in applications was seen at the School of Dental Medicine over last year while the average national increase was only 15 percent. Strenuous marketing efforts resulted in a 4 percent increase in applications at the School of Veterinary Medicine despite the very high tuition. In fact, 388 applicants competed for seventy-four openings in the new class. The School of Medicine reported having twenty-two applicants for every position in the entering class including the three MD/PhD slots. The School of Nutrition reports that the quality of its applicant pool is the best in many years. A system of rolling admissions is followed at the nutrition school, yet by late spring thirty students were expected for the fall of 1992 at the school as well as eight new students at the Frances Stern Nutrition Center in Boston. By September the nutrition school found its incoming class exceeded budgeted levels by three. Applications to the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences increased over 15 percent over last year. Applications came from over half of the states and thirty-two foreign countries. The Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences graduated its largest class ever, with twenty Ph.D. degrees and one Master of Science. The School of Dental Medicine saw the graduation of the second group of transfer students from Fairleigh Dickinson University's College of Dental Medicine. After three years of study at Tufts, a group of ten transfer students was graduated this spring. Financial Aid More than 33 percent of the entering class will receive financial aid this year up from 27 percent last year. The average size of the cohort among the institutions with which Tufts competes for students is 40 percent, but these other institutions have larger endowments than Tufts in most cases. Office of Equal Opportunity While many issues of equal rights surface throughout the course of a year, two issues were more in the forefront in the past year: sexual orientation and alleged sexual harassment. Much time was devoted to counseling students and gay-rights activists on matters of policy and questions surrounding alleged harassment about one's sexual orienta-tion. The Department of Defense policy which came out strongly against homosexuals in active military duty only exacerbated the feelings of some students and faculty on this issue. After eleven years of existence on this campus, the Office of Equal Opportunity senses that there is a more defined commitment toward affirmative action by hiring authorities in all of our schools. In most areas, the numbers are good, but there is still much work to be done. Our ability to advertise more widely and thus attract minorities to faculty positions is hampered by the tight economy. Finally, there seems to be an increasing networking of colleges and universities regarding affirmative action in particular, and also around sexual harassment issues. It was a year of difficult decisions, intense scrutiny of priorities, and purposeful planning, and as counterpoint, a year of celebrating the coming on-line of several first-rate facilities for faculty, students, and the general community. The mandate of our Arts and Sciences faculty to maintain quality and high standards faced a challenge from an increasingly adverse economic environment while, at the same time, all Arts and Sciences departments embarked on an intense self-study process under the direction of the provost in preparation for the 1992 reaccreditation. On the flip side, faculty and students alike welcomed the completion of the spacious new Olin Building for Language and Culture Studies, the sparkling Shirley and Alex Aidekman Center for the Arts, and the large, new dormitory, endowed in financially fatter years, all of which opened for use in the spring and will be officially dedicated in the fall. Over a year ago, a fourth building, the new Science and Technology Center, opened for occupancy and was officially dedicated in the fall of 1990. The reader is referred to last year's annual report for a discussion of the importance of this building. Fiscal 1991 turned over with expectation and relief for Arts and Sciences as the first day of fiscal 1992 began auspiciously with the arrival of the new vice president for arts, sciences, and technology, 1.

Only five members of the class of 1993 stood as candidates for the seven senate seats representing their class, thus the two unfilled seats were filled by students from the class of 1995. A new housing program begins in the fall called Bridge/Metcalf. This is a pilot program that it is hoped will be instituted in all dorms. The goals of the program are to create opportunities for students to bridge academic and nonacademic life, to enhance intellectual life and personal development, to increase informal, out-of-classroom contact with faculty, and to build a sense of community in residential living by expanding the range of shared activities. For a large number of students, the recession has actually brought about a pleasant change in lifestyle because of a surplus of affordable apartments. Many more eligible students chose to live off-campus and as a result, a decline in demand for dorm rooms coupled with a tight cap on enrollments at first led to the decision to close Miller Hall in the fall for renovations. However, a late and unexpected demand for dormitory rooms in September obviated the need to close Miller Hall. Had Miller closed it would not have meant a financial burden on the budget since the additional income from the large new dorm, South Hall, would offset any revenue lost. The surplus of on-campus dormitory rooms last year allowed many GSAS students together with a few graduate students from the Health Sciences schools to take advantage of on-campus housing. About fifty beds in Bush and Haskell halls were filled by graduate students. This worked so well that the same students petitioned the university to allow them the same access this year. For the 1992-1993 academic year at least eighty-nine beds will be made available for graduate students in locations near Medford Hillside. The presence of graduate students on campus has some definite advantages. It is felt by deans and administrators alike that this added dimension of diversity to campus living is indeed desirable and to be encouraged. The opportunity arose rather unexpectedly and it is perhaps too soon to evaluate the benefits to be derived from the presence of graduate students on campus or to decide how to make the most of it. A student resolution on ROTC was presented to the administra-tion. Many students object to the DOD policy of discrimination against gay men and women and bisexuals and asked the university to get out. At this point, the administration has no desire to comply but there was a feeling of the need to give DOD a clear view of the position of the university which is that exclusion of gays and bisexuals from military service is obsolete. In the spring, M.I.T. called together representatives from Boston area colleges with ROTC students to consider a response to DOD. This committee continues to meet and plan a formal action. Admissions Institutions of higher education are ranked by many factors. One factor is the number of applications to its schools and the demand for available places in each class. Student applications at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy rose another 11 percent this year, following annual increases for the last five years, as the school's reputation gains greater worldwide renown. Applications at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences increased 3.3 percent. A dramatic 35 percent increase in applications was seen at the School of Dental Medicine over last year while the average national increase was only 15 percent. Strenuous marketing efforts resulted in a 4 percent increase in applications at the School of Veterinary Medicine despite the very high tuition. In fact, 388 applicants competed for seventy-four openings in the new class. The School of Medicine reported having twenty-two applicants for every position in the entering class including the three MD/PhD slots. The School of Nutrition reports that the quality of its applicant pool is the best in many years. A system of rolling admissions is followed at the nutrition school, yet by late spring thirty students were expected for the fall of 1992 at the school as well as eight new students at the Frances Stern Nutrition Center in Boston. By September the nutrition school found its incoming class exceeded budgeted levels by three. Applications to the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences increased over 15 percent over last year. Applications came from over half of the states and thirty-two foreign countries. The Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences graduated its largest class ever, with twenty Ph.D. degrees and one Master of Science. The School of Dental Medicine saw the graduation of the second group of transfer students from Fairleigh Dickinson University's College of Dental Medicine. After three years of study at Tufts, a group of ten transfer students was graduated this spring. Financial Aid More than 33 percent of the entering class will receive financial aid this year up from 27 percent last year. The average size of the cohort among the institutions with which Tufts competes for students is 40 percent, but these other institutions have larger endowments than Tufts in most cases. Office of Equal Opportunity While many issues of equal rights surface throughout the course of a year, two issues were more in the forefront in the past year: sexual orientation and alleged sexual harassment. Much time was devoted to counseling students and gay-rights activists on matters of policy and questions surrounding alleged harassment about one's sexual orienta-tion. The Department of Defense policy which came out strongly against homosexuals in active military duty only exacerbated the feelings of some students and faculty on this issue. After eleven years of existence on this campus, the Office of Equal Opportunity senses that there is a more defined commitment toward affirmative action by hiring authorities in all of our schools. In most areas, the numbers are good, but there is still much work to be done. Our ability to advertise more widely and thus attract minorities to faculty positions is hampered by the tight economy. Finally, there seems to be an increasing networking of colleges and universities regarding affirmative action in particular, and also around sexual harassment issues. It was a year of difficult decisions, intense scrutiny of priorities, and purposeful planning, and as counterpoint, a year of celebrating the coming on-line of several first-rate facilities for faculty, students, and the general community. The mandate of our Arts and Sciences faculty to maintain quality and high standards faced a challenge from an increasingly adverse economic environment while, at the same time, all Arts and Sciences departments embarked on an intense self-study process under the direction of the provost in preparation for the 1992 reaccreditation. On the flip side, faculty and students alike welcomed the completion of the spacious new Olin Building for Language and Culture Studies, the sparkling Shirley and Alex Aidekman Center for the Arts, and the large, new dormitory, endowed in financially fatter years, all of which opened for use in the spring and will be officially dedicated in the fall. Over a year ago, a fourth building, the new Science and Technology Center, opened for occupancy and was officially dedicated in the fall of 1990. The reader is referred to last year's annual report for a discussion of the importance of this building. Fiscal 1991 turned over with expectation and relief for Arts and Sciences as the first day of fiscal 1992 began auspiciously with the arrival of the new vice president for arts, sciences, and technology, 1.

67,hvd1,5/25/91,Harvard University,Protecting Freedom of Expression on the Campus,Press,Campus CT,"For several years, universities have been struggling with the problem of trying to reconcile the rights of free speech with the desire to avoid racial tension. In recent weeks, such a controversy has sprung up at Harvard. Two students hung Confederate flags in public view, upsetting students who equate the Confederacy with slavery. A third student tried to protest the flags by displaying a swastika.1 2 These incidents have provoked much discussion and disagreement. Some students have urged that Harvard require the removal of symbols that offend many members of the community. Others reply that such symbols are a form of free speech and should be protected. 3 Different universities have resolved similar conflicts in different ways. Some have enacted codes to protect their communities from forms of speech that are deemed to be insensitive to the feelings of other groups. Some have refused to impose such restrictions. 4 It is important to distinguish between the appropriateness of such communications and their status under the First Amendment. The fact that speech is protected by the First Amendment does not necessarily mean that it is right, proper, or civil. I am sure that the vast majority of Harvard students believe that hanging a Confederate flag in public view—or displaying a swastika in response—is insensitive and unwise because any satisfaction it gives to the students who display these symbols is far outweighed by the discomfort it causes to many others. 5 I share this view and regret that the students involved saw fit to behave in this fashion. Whether or not they merely wished to manifest their pride in the South— or to demonstrate the insensitivity of hanging Confederate flags, by mounting another offensive symbol in return—they must have known that they would upset many fellow students and ignore the decent regard for the feelings of others so essential to building and preserving a strong and harmonious community. 6 To disapprove of a particular form of communication, however, is not enough to justify prohibiting it. We are faced with a clear example of the conflict between our commitment to free speech and our desire to foster a community founded on mutual respect. Our society has wrestled with this problem for many years. Interpreting the First Amendment, the Supreme Court has clearly struck the balance in favor of free speech.

Read “Protecting Freedom of Expression on the Campus” and answer the questions that follow. 1 swastika — an ancient symbol used as the emblem of Nazi Germany 7 While communities do have the right to regulate speech in order to uphold aesthetic standards (avoiding defacement of buildings) or to protect the public from disturbing noise, rules of this kind must be applied across the board and cannot be enforced selectively to prohibit certain kinds of messages but not others. 8 Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, as I read them, the display of swastikas or Confederate flags clearly falls within the protection of the free-speech clause of the First Amendment and cannot be forbidden simply because it offends the feelings of many members of the community. These rulings apply to all agencies of government, including public universities. 9 Although it is unclear to what extent the First Amendment is enforceable against private institutions, I have difficulty understanding why a university such as Harvard should have less free speech than the surrounding society—or than a public university. 10 One reason why the power of censorship is so dangerous is that it is extremely difficult to decide when a particular communication is offensive enough to warrant prohibition or to weigh the degree of offensiveness against the potential value of the communication. If we begin to forbid flags, it is only a short step to prohibiting offensive speakers. 11 I suspect that no community will become humane and caring by restricting what its members can say. The worst offenders will simply find other ways to irritate and insult. 12 In addition, once we start to declare certain things “offensive,” with all the excitement and attention that will follow, I fear that much ingenuity will be exerted trying to test the limits, much time will be expended trying to draw tenuous2 distinctions, and the resulting publicity will eventually attract more attention to the offensive material than would ever have occurred otherwise. 13 Rather than prohibit such communications, with all the resulting risks, it would be better to ignore them, since students would then have little reason to create such displays and would soon abandon them. If this response is not possible—and one can understand why—the wisest course is to speak with those who perform insensitive acts and try to help them understand the effects of their actions on others. 14 Appropriate officials and faculty members should take the lead, as the Harvard House Masters have already done in this case. In talking with students, they should seek to educate and persuade, rather than resort to ridicule or intimidation, recognizing that only persuasion is likely to produce a lasting, beneficial effect.

68,hvd2,11/14/91,Harvard University,University Debate and Freedom of Speech,Message,Campus CT,"During the past few days, there have been reports of controversial incidents related to the issue of sexual orientation. I would like to state as clearly as possible my own views on the broad range of concerns raised by these incidents: First, actions that are intimidating and are directed at specific individuals are repugnant and intolerable. The recent incident (as reported in the Crimson) involving the defacement of the door of a students room with a homophobic epithet - or similar vandalism or attacks directed at any member of the University - are not only a violation of University regulations; they are cowardly and contemptible. Second, actions that are clearly in the realm of freedom of expression and speech, that offer opinions or statements in a more general way, must be protected, even if they are offensive to some members of the community. If we find certain statements offensive, then we can respond in ways that are appropriate to a university. Some people may simply choose to ignore such views. Others may wish to debate them, offer counter-opinions, or reply with parody, wit, or ridicule. To attempt to censor such speech, however, would be totally inappropriate. Finally, debate on controversial issues is inevitable and essential I would hope, however, that all members of the community will continue to bear in mind the fundamental purposes of the University: that we are here to evaluate ideas and ask new ques-tions, but that our basic goal should be to do so in a way that actually advances the cause of learning, of new knowledge, and of understanding. It is not difficult to caricature, parody, or in a general way disparage the views of others. Indeed, sometimes - as brilliant satirists have shown us - this can be very healthy, even necessary, and can sharpen our vision of what is true. There is no question of our remaining open to a variety of forms of expression and debate. At the same time, we are also likely to serve one another best if we remember that - as members of a single university community - civil discourse, thoughtful arguments based on informed views, genuine scholarship, and careful as well as imaginative expression are at the very heart of our work as students, teachers, scholars, and staff members. It will not always be obvious how to reconcile the twin goals of guarding genuinely free expression while also attempting to build a community free of intimidation and harassment, based on a respect for individuals as well as a desire to learn from oth-ers. We will always have the problem of resolving difficult cases that are ambiguous or unclear. There is no simple solution to these dilemmas or to the tensions inherent in them. But a university by its nature should be prepared to address such complexity, to live with it, and to deal with it in ways that are constructive and humane.

69,hvd3,10/20/92,Harvard University,Casting and Recasting,Remarks,Political CT,"This is intended as a chance for all of us to express our special appreciation to Senator Kennedy and to Congressman William Ford, as well as to their staffs, for what they have accomplished this year on behalf of higher education - specifically in leading the long effort to design and finally pass the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. Many of us know that this major piece of legislation was signed in July. But few of us appreciate how much was involved in casting and recasting, debating and re-debating, and finally coaxing Congress into a sufficient state of convergence so that this fiendishly complicated bill could become law. Having watched parts of the drama from a distance and having read the relevant pages in the Congressional Record, I can unequivocally say how much higher education (especially students and their families) will benefit from the eighteen months of analysis, negotiation, and persistent hard work that were necessary to bring about this formidable achievement. I want to take a moment to outline some of the main provisions of the new Act. First, it authorizes increases in the stipend for Pell Grants, allowing them to rise incrementally every year, from $3,700 in 1993 to $4,500 by 1997. It also increases the authorization for College Work-Study Programs. Second, the new Act raises the allowable loan limits for college students, simplifies the needs-analysis process, and removes family home-equity as an item that is taken into account in federal needs analysis. Next, it takes a major step by creating a ""direct lending"" demonstration project. This will allow many students and families to borrow funds directly from universities under the federal Guaranteed Student Loan Program, rather than requiring them first to seek their loans from banks. The new process will not only be far simpler but also less expensive for everyone. Finally (and this is important, and it took literally months of discussion), new provisions were passed to allow colleges and universities to enter into purely voluntary agreements to award students financial aid on the basis of need. The institutions are also permitted to discuss broad principles that serve as a means of determining eligibility for student aid. There can be no discussion or comparison of offers to individual students, but the newly passed legislation goes a considerable distance toward correcting some of the potentially damaging effects of the situation created by the recent antitrust rulings of the Justice Department. These are only a few of the important provisions of the new bill, and none of them, during a recession and during the difficulties of an election year, was even remotely easy to manage. The effort was bipartisan, with strong help from both sides of the aisle. But it would never have happened at all had it not been for several critical people. In one sense, we know a great deal about how much Senator Kennedy does - and has done for so many years. In addition to his work on higher education, he has oversight (as chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources) of all biomedical research and training legislation in the Senate. He has been enormously influential in helping to set directions for the National Institutes of Health and has had a great effect on other health-related legislation, including childhood nutrition and the pursuit of national health insurance programs. Although he is not a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, his stature is such that he has consistently made a difference in setting priorities for tax legislation and funding. Yet all of this - plus his work in the field of immigration legis-lation, his steady support for the full participation and advancement of women and minorities in our society, and his more direct work on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts - all of this gives us only an inkling of the major role he plays in our national public life. That is because a tally of his specific accomplishments and official positions doesn't really convey what seem to me to be his most important contributions. Senator Kennedy, true to the tradition of his family, has always approached his work as if there were more to do than could be accomplished, and far too little time to do what might be attempted. Managing legislation on the Senate floor or in conference is not an activity that lends itself to portrayal in terms of the bold, broad strokes and utterances associated with heroic political leadership. As we know, it is a process that is saturated with details, that depends on the cooperation and agreement of many people, that requires months and months of patience and perseverance, and that often results in legislation so complex that the public may not recognize its significance. Under such conditions, many members of Congress - even excellent members — are pleased if they are able to pass any legislation at all. What is rare about Senator Kennedy is his extraordinary intuition, guided by deep conviction: an intuition that enables him to sense where the critical issues and the large opportunities really lie, waiting to be realized and turned into action. He is practical, he gets things done, but he doesn't see politics as merely the art of the possible. Instead, he presses more forcefully to see what might conceivably be possible if our angle of vision were shifted, if some of the apparently fixed points were moved. Walter Bagehot once remarked that ""the great pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do."" Approaching life from this vantage point does change our sense of its probabilities, and that is exactly what Senator Kennedy does as a matter of course. If you had asked me a year ago what the odds were of passing the Higher Education Reauthorization Act with all the major provisions I described earlier - especially those related to need-based aid - I doubt I would have given the idea more than a 25 percent chance. It simply didn't seem to me as if it could be done. But the Senator saw that it just perhaps might be done - and it was. There is one last point that I would like to make. So much of what Ted Kennedy achieves is the result of a commitment not to a set of abstract ideals or goals but to actual people and their wel-fare, to individuals and their daily lives, to the ways in which things can be made better for everyone. On a purely personal note, I remember that one of the first telephone calls I received after being appointed last year came from Ted. He was calling from his car, having just left a meeting. It was 11:30 at night. He simply wanted to congratulate me, to say hello, and to say how much he looked forward to meeting Angelica and me. We were still feeling slightly like displaced persons, and the call gave us very much the sense that there was someone at the other end of the telephone line who had not only sent a genuinely friendly greeting, but who was ready to help out if needed. I am certain that Ted has touched countless other people in the same way. In this respect, he shares some of the qualities that were once described by Isaiah Berlin in an essay about an American political leader from an earlier era: He evoked] an obscure feeling on the part of the majority of the citizens... that he was on their side, that he wished them well, and that he would do something for them.... He showed that it was possible to be politically effective and yet ... human.'",,Neil Rudenstine,Male,9/1/91,415,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Looking Inward,1/1/87,12/31/92,Private non-religious,Cambridge,MA,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",69,"This is intended as a chance for all of us to express our special appreciation to Senator Kennedy and to Congressman William Ford, as well as to their staffs, for what they have accomplished this year on behalf of higher education - specifically in leading the long effort to design and finally pass the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. Many of us know that this major piece of legislation was signed in July. But few of us appreciate how much was involved in casting and recasting, debating and re-debating, and finally coaxing Congress into a sufficient state of convergence so that this fiendishly complicated bill could become law. Having watched parts of the drama from a distance and having read the relevant pages in the Congressional Record, I can unequivocally say how much higher education (especially students and their families) will benefit from the eighteen months of analysis, negotiation, and persistent hard work that were necessary to bring about this formidable achievement. I want to take a moment to outline some of the main provisions of the new Act. First, it authorizes increases in the stipend for Pell Grants, allowing them to rise incrementally every year, from $3,700 in 1993 to $4,500 by 1997. It also increases the authorization for College Work-Study Programs. Second, the new Act raises the allowable loan limits for college students, simplifies the needs-analysis process, and removes family home-equity as an item that is taken into account in federal needs analysis. Next, it takes a major step by creating a ""direct lending"" demonstration project. This will allow many students and families to borrow funds directly from universities under the federal Guaranteed Student Loan Program, rather than requiring them first to seek their loans from banks. The new process will not only be far simpler but also less expensive for everyone. Finally (and this is important, and it took literally months of discussion), new provisions were passed to allow colleges and universities to enter into purely voluntary agreements to award students financial aid on the basis of need. The institutions are also permitted to discuss broad principles that serve as a means of determining eligibility for student aid. There can be no discussion or comparison of offers to individual students, but the newly passed legislation goes a considerable distance toward correcting some of the potentially damaging effects of the situation created by the recent antitrust rulings of the Justice Department. These are only a few of the important provisions of the new bill, and none of them, during a recession and during the difficulties of an election year, was even remotely easy to manage. The effort was bipartisan, with strong help from both sides of the aisle. But it would never have happened at all had it not been for several critical people. In one sense, we know a great deal about how much Senator Kennedy does - and has done for so many years. In addition to his work on higher education, he has oversight (as chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources) of all biomedical research and training legislation in the Senate. He has been enormously influential in helping to set directions for the National Institutes of Health and has had a great effect on other health-related legislation, including childhood nutrition and the pursuit of national health insurance programs. Although he is not a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, his stature is such that he has consistently made a difference in setting priorities for tax legislation and funding. Yet all of this - plus his work in the field of immigration legis-lation, his steady support for the full participation and advancement of women and minorities in our society, and his more direct work on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts - all of this gives us only an inkling of the major role he plays in our national public life. That is because a tally of his specific accomplishments and official positions doesn't really convey what seem to me to be his most important contributions. Senator Kennedy, true to the tradition of his family, has always approached his work as if there were more to do than could be accomplished, and far too little time to do what might be attempted. Managing legislation on the Senate floor or in conference is not an activity that lends itself to portrayal in terms of the bold, broad strokes and utterances associated with heroic political leadership. As we know, it is a process that is saturated with details, that depends on the cooperation and agreement of many people, that requires months and months of patience and perseverance, and that often results in legislation so complex that the public may not recognize its significance. Under such conditions, many members of Congress - even excellent members — are pleased if they are able to pass any legislation at all. What is rare about Senator Kennedy is his extraordinary intuition, guided by deep conviction: an intuition that enables him to sense where the critical issues and the large opportunities really lie, waiting to be realized and turned into action. He is practical, he gets things done, but he doesn't see politics as merely the art of the possible. Instead, he presses more forcefully to see what might conceivably be possible if our angle of vision were shifted, if some of the apparently fixed points were moved. Walter Bagehot once remarked that ""the great pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do."" Approaching life from this vantage point does change our sense of its probabilities, and that is exactly what Senator Kennedy does as a matter of course. If you had asked me a year ago what the odds were of passing the Higher Education Reauthorization Act with all the major provisions I described earlier - especially those related to need-based aid - I doubt I would have given the idea more than a 25 percent chance. It simply didn't seem to me as if it could be done. But the Senator saw that it just perhaps might be done - and it was. There is one last point that I would like to make. So much of what Ted Kennedy achieves is the result of a commitment not to a set of abstract ideals or goals but to actual people and their wel-fare, to individuals and their daily lives, to the ways in which things can be made better for everyone. On a purely personal note, I remember that one of the first telephone calls I received after being appointed last year came from Ted. He was calling from his car, having just left a meeting. It was 11:30 at night. He simply wanted to congratulate me, to say hello, and to say how much he looked forward to meeting Angelica and me. We were still feeling slightly like displaced persons, and the call gave us very much the sense that there was someone at the other end of the telephone line who had not only sent a genuinely friendly greeting, but who was ready to help out if needed. I am certain that Ted has touched countless other people in the same way. In this respect, he shares some of the qualities that were once described by Isaiah Berlin in an essay about an American political leader from an earlier era: He evoked] an obscure feeling on the part of the majority of the citizens... that he was on their side, that he wished them well, and that he would do something for them....

Throughout this proceeding, as in the election campaign itself, Harvard has wanted to insure that our employees had a fair and informed opportunity to decide whether to be represented by a union. Following a closely divided vote on May 17, the University received many complaints about union efforts to get out the vote on election day. These complaints raised a substantial doubt as to whether the methods that the union had used were in conformance with existing rules governing the conduct of union elections. In order to make sure that the election was fair, Harvard filed objections with the National Labor Relations Board. Last week, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a report recommending that the Board uphold the election and certify the union.

73,dpu1,3/22/10,DePaul University,A University Commitment to Diversity,Remarks,Campus CT,"Good morning. I'm grateful and honored for the opportunity to join you today and to learn from my colleagues in the Netherlands. Thank you for your warm welcome. Shakespeare once co-wrote, with several other playwrights, a play called ""Sir Thomas More."" He contributed only three pages to the play, but the particular three pages, early in the play's story, are arguably the play's most frightening and compelling moment. As the play opens, immigrants have flooded London. They are poor, dirty, and different. In the opening scene, wealthy men harass an immigrant, married couple. The poor man has his food taken from him, and his wife is sexually harassed. That simple incident incites the long- suffering immigrants to form a mob, intending to burn the town of London to the ground. A mob of wealthy citizens, now fearful, gather to lynch all strangers and immigrants in London. The mobs have gathered, prepared their weapons, stirred up their righteous indignation and hatred, and are prepared to fight, when Master Thomas More, a wealthy Londoner himself and Sheriff, risks his own safety to stop the insanity. He turns to the wealthy: MORE What is it you seek? GEORGE The removing of the strangers. MORE Say now the king should banish you, Where would you go? What country should give you harbor? Go you to France..., To any German province, to Spain or Portugal, Nay, anywhere that not adheres to England - Why, YOU [will be strangers. Would you be pleased To find a nation of such barbarous temper, That, breaking out in hideous violence, Would not afford you a bode on earth, Whet their detested knives against your throats, Spurn you like dogs? What would YOU think to be thus used? This is the strangers' case; And this your mountainish inhumanity. Yield yourselves. One by one, the wealthy men lay down their weapons, and walk away The fear of the stranger is carried in our bones as human beings. The powerful in society have always feared those who are new, and who might one day become powerful themselves. Hithe fanned the fear that the Jews were plotting the dilution and overthrow of German society. ume United States justified the enslavement of African people by claiming that they were not human; that they were less-than-human; that they might rise up against their owners; that the bible justified slavery. Women in my country were said to be too simple-minded and emotionally unstable to be allowed to vote; that democracy would fail if women were given power over it; that the bible taught the subserviency of women. When 20-year-old college student Matthew Shepherd was stripped, beaten, stabbed and left tied to a fence to die in Wyoming, a Christian minister and his church members stood outside the funeral church as his mother and father exited with their son's coffin, screaming, ""God hates gays."" Fear must always be justified. And, fear is always justified by claiming that ""the others"" are subhuman; dangerous; and frequently, that God is against them too. This fear of the different. This fear of loss of power. How do we break these powerful forces? I have been asked to speak to you today on the idea of Diversity in Higher Education. That makes me happy to be here, for I believe that universities play a key role in assisting societies to incorporate new immigrants, and to help immigrants take their place in society. My university, DePaul University, is the largest Catholic university in the United States, but to properly understand DePaul, you need to understand that our university is not for Catholics. DePaul was founded because, in the 1890's, the other universities in Chicago by-and-large refused to accept Catholics and Jews, who comprised the great majority of Chicago's new immigrants. So DePaul began a university that would never admit students on the basis of religion; a university that would welcome immigrants of all kinds. And so DePaul became the only place for Catholic immigrants to study, but also the only place for Jews to study. We were the first to admit women students for business and law degrees in Chicago. Our early student bodies reflected Chicago's immigrant population at the turn of the 20th century - Irish, Polish, Italian, Czech, Greek - groups that were not welcome at other universities. We were among the early institutions to accept African-Americans in Chicago. These students were for the most part the first in their families to attend college. Today, our students are still African-American and Hispanic, but also Turkish, Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Vietnamese, Nigerian, as well as new generations of Polish, Russian and other ethnic immigrant students. They are still, in many cases, the first in their families to attend college, and they are still becoming our lawyers, teachers, business people and artists. If you visited DePaul's student center, you would find a campus where we currently have a two Islamic prayer rooms; a space for Hillel, the Jewish student organization; a place for the Buddhist students to meditate, a place for the Protestant and other Christian organizations to gather, and a chapel for the Catholic students to have daily Mass. We teach Islamic Studies, Jewish Studies, Catholie Studies. We have a Multicultural Center, and a Center for the Black Diaspora, and more. And so, it wasn't a complete surprise when the Princeton Review last school year ranked DePaul as first in the nation for ""Diversity."" 32 percent of the freshmen are students of color. 39% are the first in their families to go to college. And, yes, we are the only Catholie university in the world with a Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Studies program. But the Princeton Review didn't name us first because of the numbers. Other universities in the United States are even more diverse than we are. No, it turns out 115,000 college students were surveyed in the U.S., and it sees our students observed that we had created a real community out of all that diversity. And THIS surprised us a bit. We know we have many challenges, and we certainly don't measure up to our own ideals. Societies react to new immigrants in their midst, sometimes with violence, often with ugly incidents designed to tell the immigrants they are not wanted. In the past few years, we have had to confront some contentious and disturbing incidents at DePaul: • Protests surrounding an exhibit of Palestinian art and its accompanying historical texts; : Swastikas and anti-Semitic symbols painted on the walls of the student center. ""Faggot"" and ""kill the gays"" written on the walls of a dormitory. • We've had anti-immigrant speakers inside one building, while hundreds of immigrants were protesting outside, shutting down the street. • I've had our ""Women's and Gender Studies"" program staging a play called ""The Vagina Monologues,"" while 3800 protesters tried to shut down my email system. • I had a professor yell in the middle of the student center that all Muslim students are terrorists, and then I was accused of reverse-racism when we did not hire him back. • I've had students protest graduation and even take over my office boardroom for three days, protesting me personally when I refused to give tenure to someone who supported Palestinian Rights, while others claimed that I was too supportive of the Palestinians and not supportive enough of the Jewish cause. • Barack Obama gave a major speech on foreign policy at DePaul, and conservative Catholic groups criticized the university for being too liberal. (They actually said I was going to hell.) Then, later that year when I protected the right of a conservative speaker, Fox News Commentator Bill O'Reilly, the liberals protested that the university was too conservative. All of this and more in just the six years that I have been president. From what I hear, your university has not experienced such public, bad behavior. I'm very glad to hear it. It speaks well of your new generation, and gives hope to Dutch society in the future. I'm afraid, however, that's not the common experience worldwide whenever universities accept new populations. More often, universities reproduce, inside their institution, the dynamics of the society around them. I tell you all this so that I can share five lessons I've come to believe about leadership for diversity. First, I have learned that controversy creates opportunities for education. In the United States, universities like mine bring together young members of groups who have often been raised completely within one culture or religion or language group, and do not know others' cultures. Our universities are microcosms of the larger world's social boundaries, and sometimes because of youthful idealism and ignorance, battles develop inside the university. I've learned to expect it and to never be surprised by it. Our job is not to create a controversy-side-by-side. free zone. Nor is our job to create the peaceable kingdom where the lion and the lamb lie down No, our job is to educate for citizenship. Moments of controversy become moments to teach students more fully about the matter at hand, and also to teach them about civil discourse - how to discuss differences of opinion with passion and conviction, but also with respect and open-minds. What's important to us at DePaul is that we move swiftly to restate our values about true human community and to offer our students a chance to learn from this. When a Palestinian art exhibit upset the Jewish students and local Jewish community because of the way it portrayed the founding of Israel, we immediately scheduled a conference of historians from both traditions in order to teach students about historical sources and method, and how history is used politically. Students observed Palestinian, Jewish and other scholars working together, debating, and coming to agreement. They saw passionate civil discourse at its best. Diversity can bring conflict, but it also offers teachable moments when conversations on important matters can be fostered, and when we can model how to engage difficult dialogues and rebuild fractured community. Committing to a diverse organization means a commitment to help members of the organization manage these differences and misunderstandings when they occur. It's the price of our ideals. The second lesson I have learned is that if I accept a diverse student body, I am also accepting responsibility for their success. In the United States, white students graduate from college in higher numbers than African-American students or Hispanic students. My university actively recruits diverse students. We purposely send high school recruiting teams to urban high schools to encourage young people to enroll in college. I believe that means we must also commit to providing them with the resources they may need to complete their university studies. At DePaul, here are some of the programs and initiatives we've undertaken to help our diverse student succeed. You may wish to ask more about these in the discussion that will follow these remarks. 1. Student mentoring programs, designed to assign students a personal advisor to constantly check on their progress and talk about their progress, and solve any problems that might be impeding that progress. 2. Strategies to hire a diverse faculty, staff and administration, so that students will see people like themselves, and thereby believe that it is possible for them to succeed as well. I track these numbers four times a year, and watch them very closely. 3. We participate in a program to fund graduate students of color, hoping they will become available for hire. faculty one day and thereby increase the numbers of such professionals in the country 4. Like many universities in the United States, DePaul revised its core curriculum. We now require all students to take courses in the history and literature of diverse cultures, rather than just U.S. or European history. We believe this is a more responsible education, but we also hope it has the effect of helping students to find their own culture's history and build their intellectual curiosity. 5. In the United States, we frequently find that students from urban areas received a substandard education in their public schools. They are very bright, but they are not as prepared for university level work as are their peers who received a better schooling. To help students succeed, we have created tutoring programs where students can go for extra help after class. We've created an academic support center where students can learn time-management training, study skills, and organizational habits. We have established numerous remedial classes, where students can learn at the university material they should have learned in high school. Recently, we began offering these classes for free, if students agree to take them in the summer before their freshman year begins. Our hope is that they will then be able to join their classmates, and stay on track for a time graduation. 8. We have set up classes in financial management, since so many of our students from underprepared backgrounds leave the university without a degree for financial reasons. 9. We do orientation programs for families, particularly targeting those whose children are the first in the family to attend college. We also do programming and events for the family to come to campus during the school year, so that the family is part of the university, understand better and support the work being done by this student. We have a website where parents and other family members can ask questions and get fast answers to their questions. 10. We do a great deal of cultural programming, so that students can find each other in a big university, and also feel that the campus respects their cultures. We also do a great deal of cross-cultural programming so that students groups will mix with one another. 11. We a train the student leaders of all the many student cultural groups, teaching them how to set a tone of inclusiveness. 12. We have psychologists and social workers on staff to assist when necessary. 13. Finally, we formally assign responsibilities to some of our employees. We have a Vice President for Diversity. There are other assistant vice presidents and directors who focus on this as well. If diversity is everyone's job, then it is also no one's job. So, we hire specialists to focus on helping our diverse students to succeed. In the end, students from families who have few financial resources are often one family or personal crisis away from dropping out of school. I have come to believe that if we accept these students, we must help them manage these crises if we can. There is no need for a university to hire psychologists, or social workers on staff, but you will need to at least refer students for help when they need it. Some universities in the United States create vast support services. Others create referral services. Which you choose does not matter, so long as you realize that first-generation students often require assistance at key moments along the way. Third, you must survey, measure and report. In the 1990's, I was hired by the Ford Foundation to investigate a set of diversity initiatives at a university in Chicago. The Foundation had given significant money to help fund these initiatives, and other foundations had similarly given money to the same university. They set up numerous programs to assist their African-American students, their Hispanic students, their Asian students, their first-generation students, and more. Sadly, after they had spent all that money, they finally found that their graduation rates were appalling. Barely 10 percent of their students were graduating. What they had done was design programs without surveying the students first. They never conducted exit interviews with students who left to find out the real reasons they did not stay. I firmly believe that you must measure the graduation rates and retention rates of your students. You must conduct exit interviews with students who leave to find out why they leave. We you must survey current students to find out what needs they have. We must evaluate our programs to see if they make a difference. In the end, we must measure, evaluate, and report. It's the only way to improve our practice. Fourth, there are larger contributions a university can make to its society. You're making one of them today, merely by hosting this conference. Convening critical conversations for a society is an important role of universities. • Providing research to your society - helping your society understand those who are different in their midst - is also a powerful contribution. This is especially important since fear is often spread by misinformation, which can only be addressed by data. Data must come from respected, impartial sources. You can be that respected, impartial source. • Helping governments craft responsible and effective public policy. • Helping social service and public health fields adjust their efforts appropriately. • Assisting schools and teachers to implement effective learning techniques for these new populations. • Through poetry, dance, literature, the stage and all the arts, finding ways to help the larger world understand the experience of the stranger in their midst, helping society overcome its fear, and protect the nobility of the human heart. • Marshalling the student labor at your hand through service and service-learning activities to assist diverse populations in your city. • Even if you only model internally the society that you desire around you, a generation of young people will learn how to live together for the future. And of course, most importantly of all, you educate those who are considered the stranger in your midst. This is perhaps the most transformative activity you undertake. Merely by teaching a new immigrant how to translate a sentence, differentiate a partial equation, interpret an ancient political text, or how to speak a new language, you undermine those who would keep the immigrants from advancing on your society. Every time you teach a lesson and graduate a student, you build a new society. Which leads me to another important point: The best diversity strategy a university can have is high standards. I mean that. High Standards. The more students learn, the more prepared they are to compete for good jobs, the more likely that they will enter into society fully, take important leadership positions, and integrate your society. A university with low standards provides students no benefit whatsoever, and is a terrible thing. If you remember nothing else about what I say today, I beg you to remember this: The best diversity strategy a university can have is high standards. Make the students work hard. Make them learn a field very well. Prepare them to compete with the best, and then you will have lived up to your ideals But there is yet another reason for universities to bring together a diverse student body. I believe that diversity is good for everyone who attends a university like InHolland. At DePaul, we believe that students are better prepared for their professional lives and for their roles as world citizens if they study in a diverse community. We believe their education is enriched if they must study economics with classmates who grew up at the low socioeconomic end of society as well as the high end. We believe they understand better how to lead school systems, and courtrooms and hospital emergency rooms, when they've learned alongside classmates who actually look like the city or the world in all its diversity. We're preparing our students for the world, and it is important to educate them for the real world in which they will live. None of this is easy work. Universities are notoriously transient organizations. Every year, new students arrive. New faculty arrive. The political landscape changes around you. Just at the moment that you believe you have created a harmonious community, you will find that you must start over again. I encourage you not to lose heart. Universities are powerful and noble forces in society. The intellectual and human resources can make a powerful contribution to whatever social needs present themselves. Lastly, I believe that commitments to diversity are commitments to understand one another. And not just our students understanding each other, but all of us. Many years ago, I taught at a university that was highly diverse on paper-nearly 50 percent of the students were students of color, with over 60 different languages spoken in their homes. But at the university, the truth could be seen in our cafeteria. People ate with people who looked like themselves. People walked across campus in subgroups that looked like themselves. A campus of homogenous subgroupings is not diversity. That's proximity. Diversity is more than numbers of diverse students. At a university, there's a chance that our students can learn from one another, and that's our most important objective. In the United States, we use words like 'tolerance"" and ""respect."" But true diversity is not tolerance or even respect. It is community. And community is ultimately intentional. You only meet your neighbors by walking across the street or across the hallway to say hello to them. Community happens because someone makes the first step to say hello and build a relationship. Large organizations build true diversity when they assist these relationships to flourish. At DePaul, I frequently tell people that diversity means more than just a recruiting exercise. It is more than saying that our faculty, and staff, and senior leadership, and board membership-all in addition to our student body— reflect the diversity of Chicago and the world around us. And it is more than creating moments to celebrate the diversity of our community by eating each other's foods, listening to each other's music and celebrating each other's heroes. I tell them that true diversity means creating true community. James Baldwin, arguably the finest writer of the Harlem Renaissance, described in his first novel — the powerful, ""Go Tell it on the Mountain"" — What it was like to walk down the streets of Manhattan as a young black teenager. He wrote of a young black man named John, wro observed the people as he walked through midtown Manhattan, ""whose eyes held no love for him. And he thought of their feet so swift and brutal, and the dark gray clothes they wore, and how when they passed they did not see him, or, if they saw him, they smirked. And how their lights, unceasing crashed on and off above him, and how he was a stranger there."" A page later in the novel, though, John climbed a snowy hill in Central Park, tumbled down in the snow for the sheer fun of it. ""At the bottom of the hill, where the ground abruptly leveled off onto a gravel path, he nearly knocked down an old white man with a white beard, who was walking very slowly and leaning on his cane. They both stopped, astonished, and looked at one another. John struggled to catch his breath and apologize, but the old man smiled. John smiled back. It was as though he and the old man had between them a great secret; and the old man moved on."" That point of contact. That relationship. That's the goal. Not proximity, not tolerance, not even respect. COMMUNITY. Our world talks quite a bit about diversity, equal opportunity, the global village, doing business internationally. But synagogues are still vandalized, people do not want mosques in their communities, racism exists and our best instincts toward acceptance and understanding are challenged by religious extremism, racial and ethnic violence, and civic dialogue that is anything but civil. I think our students need to be prepared for that and they need to have the tools and the desire to try to change it. We're educators. We shape our lives and our vision of the world on the hope that humanity can be civilized if only it is taught well, especially if it is taught to live in civil society, to build true community. What Shakespeare described several hundred years ago is still true today. Societies still find it difficult to accept and integrate new populations into their midst. Your university is a powerful solution to a social challenge. And that is what all of you do each day. I have great respect for InHolland University. You are to be commended for your intentions to change Dutch society by educating a broader array of its citizens. No institution is perfect. None of us live up to our ideals, but you have ideals, important ideals, and I respect you for it. I wish you well with the work ahead of you. Please count on DePaul University in Chicago as your friend and colleague. I hope we will find ways to work together in the future. Thank you for inviting me to join you today. And thank you for accepting this noble and magnificent task. God bless you.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qqfLD_EIwbDGL8MGg0iQhqpF8XqCoEZ0KKEkpG8rqcg/edit?tab=t.ylugk9g8qglq,Dennis Holtschneider,Male,7/1/04,2090,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Sept. 11 & Recession,1/1/93,12/31/11,Private religious,Chicago,IL,Midwest,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",73,"Good morning. I'm grateful and honored for the opportunity to join you today and to learn from my colleagues in the Netherlands. Thank you for your warm welcome. Shakespeare once co-wrote, with several other playwrights, a play called ""Sir Thomas More."" He contributed only three pages to the play, but the particular three pages, early in the play's story, are arguably the play's most frightening and compelling moment. As the play opens, immigrants have flooded London. They are poor, dirty, and different. In the opening scene, wealthy men harass an immigrant, married couple. The poor man has his food taken from him, and his wife is sexually harassed. That simple incident incites the long- suffering immigrants to form a mob, intending to burn the town of London to the ground. A mob of wealthy citizens, now fearful, gather to lynch all strangers and immigrants in London. The mobs have gathered, prepared their weapons, stirred up their righteous indignation and hatred, and are prepared to fight, when Master Thomas More, a wealthy Londoner himself and Sheriff, risks his own safety to stop the insanity. He turns to the wealthy: MORE What is it you seek? GEORGE The removing of the strangers. MORE Say now the king should banish you, Where would you go? What country should give you harbor? Go you to France..., To any German province, to Spain or Portugal, Nay, anywhere that not adheres to England - Why, YOU [will be strangers. Would you be pleased To find a nation of such barbarous temper, That, breaking out in hideous violence, Would not afford you a bode on earth, Whet their detested knives against your throats, Spurn you like dogs? What would YOU think to be thus used? This is the strangers' case; And this your mountainish inhumanity. Yield yourselves. One by one, the wealthy men lay down their weapons, and walk away The fear of the stranger is carried in our bones as human beings. The powerful in society have always feared those who are new, and who might one day become powerful themselves. Hithe fanned the fear that the Jews were plotting the dilution and overthrow of German society. ume United States justified the enslavement of African people by claiming that they were not human; that they were less-than-human; that they might rise up against their owners; that the bible justified slavery. Women in my country were said to be too simple-minded and emotionally unstable to be allowed to vote; that democracy would fail if women were given power over it; that the bible taught the subserviency of women. When 20-year-old college student Matthew Shepherd was stripped, beaten, stabbed and left tied to a fence to die in Wyoming, a Christian minister and his church members stood outside the funeral church as his mother and father exited with their son's coffin, screaming, ""God hates gays."" Fear must always be justified. And, fear is always justified by claiming that ""the others"" are subhuman; dangerous; and frequently, that God is against them too. This fear of the different. This fear of loss of power. How do we break these powerful forces? I have been asked to speak to you today on the idea of Diversity in Higher Education. That makes me happy to be here, for I believe that universities play a key role in assisting societies to incorporate new immigrants, and to help immigrants take their place in society. My university, DePaul University, is the largest Catholic university in the United States, but to properly understand DePaul, you need to understand that our university is not for Catholics. DePaul was founded because, in the 1890's, the other universities in Chicago by-and-large refused to accept Catholics and Jews, who comprised the great majority of Chicago's new immigrants. So DePaul began a university that would never admit students on the basis of religion; a university that would welcome immigrants of all kinds. And so DePaul became the only place for Catholic immigrants to study, but also the only place for Jews to study. We were the first to admit women students for business and law degrees in Chicago. Our early student bodies reflected Chicago's immigrant population at the turn of the 20th century - Irish, Polish, Italian, Czech, Greek - groups that were not welcome at other universities. We were among the early institutions to accept African-Americans in Chicago. These students were for the most part the first in their families to attend college. Today, our students are still African-American and Hispanic, but also Turkish, Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Vietnamese, Nigerian, as well as new generations of Polish, Russian and other ethnic immigrant students. They are still, in many cases, the first in their families to attend college, and they are still becoming our lawyers, teachers, business people and artists. If you visited DePaul's student center, you would find a campus where we currently have a two Islamic prayer rooms; a space for Hillel, the Jewish student organization; a place for the Buddhist students to meditate, a place for the Protestant and other Christian organizations to gather, and a chapel for the Catholic students to have daily Mass. We teach Islamic Studies, Jewish Studies, Catholie Studies. We have a Multicultural Center, and a Center for the Black Diaspora, and more. And so, it wasn't a complete surprise when the Princeton Review last school year ranked DePaul as first in the nation for ""Diversity."" 32 percent of the freshmen are students of color. 39% are the first in their families to go to college. And, yes, we are the only Catholie university in the world with a Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender Studies program. But the Princeton Review didn't name us first because of the numbers. Other universities in the United States are even more diverse than we are. No, it turns out 115,000 college students were surveyed in the U.S., and it sees our students observed that we had created a real community out of all that diversity. And THIS surprised us a bit. We know we have many challenges, and we certainly don't measure up to our own ideals. Societies react to new immigrants in their midst, sometimes with violence, often with ugly incidents designed to tell the immigrants they are not wanted. In the past few years, we have had to confront some contentious and disturbing incidents at DePaul: • Protests surrounding an exhibit of Palestinian art and its accompanying historical texts; : Swastikas and anti-Semitic symbols painted on the walls of the student center. ""Faggot"" and ""kill the gays"" written on the walls of a dormitory. • We've had anti-immigrant speakers inside one building, while hundreds of immigrants were protesting outside, shutting down the street. • I've had our ""Women's and Gender Studies"" program staging a play called ""The Vagina Monologues,"" while 3800 protesters tried to shut down my email system. • I had a professor yell in the middle of the student center that all Muslim students are terrorists, and then I was accused of reverse-racism when we did not hire him back. • I've had students protest graduation and even take over my office boardroom for three days, protesting me personally when I refused to give tenure to someone who supported Palestinian Rights, while others claimed that I was too supportive of the Palestinians and not supportive enough of the Jewish cause. • Barack Obama gave a major speech on foreign policy at DePaul, and conservative Catholic groups criticized the university for being too liberal. (They actually said I was going to hell.) Then, later that year when I protected the right of a conservative speaker, Fox News Commentator Bill O'Reilly, the liberals protested that the university was too conservative. All of this and more in just the six years that I have been president. From what I hear, your university has not experienced such public, bad behavior. I'm very glad to hear it. It speaks well of your new generation, and gives hope to Dutch society in the future. I'm afraid, however, that's not the common experience worldwide whenever universities accept new populations. More often, universities reproduce, inside their institution, the dynamics of the society around them. I tell you all this so that I can share five lessons I've come to believe about leadership for diversity. First, I have learned that controversy creates opportunities for education. In the United States, universities like mine bring together young members of groups who have often been raised completely within one culture or religion or language group, and do not know others' cultures. Our universities are microcosms of the larger world's social boundaries, and sometimes because of youthful idealism and ignorance, battles develop inside the university. I've learned to expect it and to never be surprised by it. Our job is not to create a controversy-side-by-side. free zone. Nor is our job to create the peaceable kingdom where the lion and the lamb lie down No, our job is to educate for citizenship. Moments of controversy become moments to teach students more fully about the matter at hand, and also to teach them about civil discourse - how to discuss differences of opinion with passion and conviction, but also with respect and open-minds. What's important to us at DePaul is that we move swiftly to restate our values about true human community and to offer our students a chance to learn from this. When a Palestinian art exhibit upset the Jewish students and local Jewish community because of the way it portrayed the founding of Israel, we immediately scheduled a conference of historians from both traditions in order to teach students about historical sources and method, and how history is used politically. Students observed Palestinian, Jewish and other scholars working together, debating, and coming to agreement. They saw passionate civil discourse at its best. Diversity can bring conflict, but it also offers teachable moments when conversations on important matters can be fostered, and when we can model how to engage difficult dialogues and rebuild fractured community. Committing to a diverse organization means a commitment to help members of the organization manage these differences and misunderstandings when they occur. It's the price of our ideals. The second lesson I have learned is that if I accept a diverse student body, I am also accepting responsibility for their success. In the United States, white students graduate from college in higher numbers than African-American students or Hispanic students. My university actively recruits diverse students. We purposely send high school recruiting teams to urban high schools to encourage young people to enroll in college. I believe that means we must also commit to providing them with the resources they may need to complete their university studies. At DePaul, here are some of the programs and initiatives we've undertaken to help our diverse student succeed. You may wish to ask more about these in the discussion that will follow these remarks. 1. Student mentoring programs, designed to assign students a personal advisor to constantly check on their progress and talk about their progress, and solve any problems that might be impeding that progress. 2. Strategies to hire a diverse faculty, staff and administration, so that students will see people like themselves, and thereby believe that it is possible for them to succeed as well. I track these numbers four times a year, and watch them very closely. 3. We participate in a program to fund graduate students of color, hoping they will become available for hire. faculty one day and thereby increase the numbers of such professionals in the country 4. Like many universities in the United States, DePaul revised its core curriculum. We now require all students to take courses in the history and literature of diverse cultures, rather than just U.S. or European history. We believe this is a more responsible education, but we also hope it has the effect of helping students to find their own culture's history and build their intellectual curiosity. 5. In the United States, we frequently find that students from urban areas received a substandard education in their public schools. They are very bright, but they are not as prepared for university level work as are their peers who received a better schooling. To help students succeed, we have created tutoring programs where students can go for extra help after class. We've created an academic support center where students can learn time-management training, study skills, and organizational habits. We have established numerous remedial classes, where students can learn at the university material they should have learned in high school. Recently, we began offering these classes for free, if students agree to take them in the summer before their freshman year begins. Our hope is that they will then be able to join their classmates, and stay on track for a time graduation. 8. We have set up classes in financial management, since so many of our students from underprepared backgrounds leave the university without a degree for financial reasons. 9. We do orientation programs for families, particularly targeting those whose children are the first in the family to attend college. We also do programming and events for the family to come to campus during the school year, so that the family is part of the university, understand better and support the work being done by this student. We have a website where parents and other family members can ask questions and get fast answers to their questions. 10. We do a great deal of cultural programming, so that students can find each other in a big university, and also feel that the campus respects their cultures. We also do a great deal of cross-cultural programming so that students groups will mix with one another. 11. We a train the student leaders of all the many student cultural groups, teaching them how to set a tone of inclusiveness. 12. We have psychologists and social workers on staff to assist when necessary. 13. Finally, we formally assign responsibilities to some of our employees. We have a Vice President for Diversity. There are other assistant vice presidents and directors who focus on this as well. If diversity is everyone's job, then it is also no one's job. So, we hire specialists to focus on helping our diverse students to succeed. In the end, students from families who have few financial resources are often one family or personal crisis away from dropping out of school. I have come to believe that if we accept these students, we must help them manage these crises if we can. There is no need for a university to hire psychologists, or social workers on staff, but you will need to at least refer students for help when they need it. Some universities in the United States create vast support services. Others create referral services. Which you choose does not matter, so long as you realize that first-generation students often require assistance at key moments along the way. Third, you must survey, measure and report.

75,dpu3,2/15/06,DePaul University,DePaul review of 'bake sale' complete,Message,Campus CT,"Recently, a student organization held what has become known on college campuses across the nation as an ""affirmative action bake sale."" It was a provocative event viewed by many as an affront to DePaul's values of respect and dignity, inclusiveness and diversity. Concurrently, it raised questions about our commitment to free speech. DePaul has completed a comprehensive review of the event to determine whether it violated our Student Code of Conduct or our new Anti-Discriminatory Harassment Policy. The reviewer interviewed or consulted with 20 people, including members of the DePaul Conservative Alliance (DCA), which hosted the event, and students who challenged the message DCA explained in the review that its event was designed to be a ""satirical protest"" against affirmative action, particularly as it relates to admission policies, that would generate awareness and prompt discourse on the topic. The event, which included a menu board with prices based on one's race and gender, has been viewed by members of the university community as blatantly offensive and contrary to many of DePaul's core values. The review concluded that the bake sale was a protest and was intentionally misrepresented by DCA in its promotion table application, violating the Student Code of Conduct. As a result of these findings, the organization has been censured, and sanctions have been applied. Our review also determined that the event did not violate the Anti-Discriminatory Harassment Policy because it was not directed at an individual, did not disrupt academic activity and did not demonstrate a pattern necessary to create a hostile environment. TePaul has always been a pioneer in enrolling a broad array of students when other institutions would not. This proud s. gacy extends beyond racial minorities, to female, Jewish and Catholic students early in the 20th century. DePaul is proud of its history of welcoming students of many traditions and backgrounds to the university and then creating an atmosphere of respect and care for them. I support DCA's right to hold a protest on the topic of affirmative action. What I find troubling is that the protest was intentionally located across from the university's Cultural Center, a place where our students of color organize numerous enriching events for the campus community. I am not objecting that the event was, in DCA's own words, meant ""to be incendiary."" I am concerned that there is an appearance of having been directed specifically toward one group of the university community rather than the university community as a whole. In my opinion, this doesn't rise to the level of DePaul's commitment to create a welcoming atmosphere for all. DePaul is committed to free speech, and as part of that commitment, we understand that we must allow even those activities that might startle or offend to take place, as long as those activities do not violate campus behavior policies. I hope our campus community knows that the university itself does not endorse a message merely because it permits it to be expressed. Our ancestors, who gave us the gift of free speech, understood that if we limit freedom of expression for one, then we limit it for all. They taught us that the best way to counter speech with which we disagree is to greet it with more speech. Because of that, I am particularly grateful to the many student groups, faculty and staff who took the time to respond to this bake sale. They demonstrated both DePaul's deepest values and its commitment to vigorous debate. To add to this response, I have asked Helmut Epp, executive vice president for Academic Affairs, and Elizabeth Ortiz senior executive for Institutional Diversity, to sponsor a series of forums on free speech and affirmative action at DePaul. These events will engage the academic units, Faculty Council, Student Affairs, University Mission and Values, Institutional Diversity, Staff Council, the Student Government Association and student organizations in forums that will be open to faculty, staff and students. Information about these events will be posted on the Student Affairs Web site and available in the DePaulia once they are scheduled. This will complement the number of meetings and forums that already have been held to discuss the impact of this event on the DePaul community. I am very pleased that a diverse group of students have participated in these meetings and discussions. Many universities are confronting these issues, and I anticipate a continuing conversation here as well. We engage in a aily balancing act as we affirm our strong commitment to free speech and academic freedom while living the values that are integral to our mission. Both intellectual discourse and the Vincentian tradition itself always begin with respect and dignity.

76,dpu4,4/12/95,DePaul University,Memorandum to the University Community,Message,Campus CT,"Before Easter I want to inform the University community on what is happening at DePaul. I have great respect for all the hard work of so many students, staff and faculty to bring negotiations to a successful resolution. By staging a sit-in at the student newspaper some of our students are clearly voicing the hurts they feel as an African-American community, and they are requesting a set of working proposals for change within the administration and The DePaulia. Other students at The DePaulia have voiced concerns that channels for diverse opinions, even controversial opinions, remain open. The administration agrees with these concerns, and has put other proposals on the table regarding how to facilitate positive change. I want to communicate to you what the issues are and what has been accomplished to date. There have been weeks of very serious discussions on these issues which are very real and fundamental to achieving a diverse community. I am disappointed that more progress has not been made. Yet, we cannot let these frustrations diminish hope that all sides can reach an understanding and move forward. DePaul is committed to achieve excellence through diversity. By choosing to be at DePaul we are committed to being part of a diverse community. Diversity of perspectives and the freedom to voice differing perspectives are what a university is about. I am proud that the students involved in the discussions have not let these behaviors and words distract them from the important issues at hand. I find it deplorable that a very few individuals have taken this opportunity to say, print or act in a rude or hurtful manner. Such intentional disrespect will not be tolerated. By way of background, a fight started among outsiders at a student dance on February 10 that was attended by nearly 500 people in Stuart Center on the Lincoln Park campus. The Chicago Police were called and drew their guns in response to an erroneous report of a gun being present. In an ensuing scuffle, three of our students were injured and needed medical attention. Some property and money was lost. One student was arrested for not immediately following the instructions of a Chicago Police officer. The injuries were cared for, the money and property were restored and immediate counsel was provided by the university to the arrested student to secure release and dismissal. What hasn't been restored is the respect and healing of the personal hurt felt by our students. A thorough review by an outside investigator was conducted into the events of February 10. The report revealed that: we did not have sufficient security to manage an affair of this size; that security measures put in place restricted students needing to leave the building because their coats on this below-freezing evening were all in a single closet; and that there was no coordination between sponsors of the dance and security when the fight broke out. The point is that DePaul failed to care properly for its students at a very good student event. I deeply apologize to each student present, especially those most traumatized by this incident. A letter of reprimand has gone to all those responsible for managing the dance. This letter was sent following the completion of the investigation on March 11. The departments involved have responded by initiating the following: • Conducting a complete evaluation of security procedures and staffing for student events to ensure the well-being, enjoyment and safety of our participants. • Initiating sensitivity and diversity programs for staff. Establishing a University Security Advisory Board. • Appointing a security liaison officer to work with student organizations to improve event planning • Proposing a university-wide diversity awareness program. • Continuing to improve multicultural staffing initiatives. We are committed to implementing whatever other actions it takes to achieve a strong working relationship between all responsible for ensuring the well-being of our students and the safety of our events. One of the issues that has been raised is the dismissal of various staff and students. I am committed to changing the future through education, not by dismissing people. This does not mean I agree with what has been said or done. The point of education is to move from a narrow view of people and the world to one that can embrace differences. Apologies are still needed for the hurt felt and respect lost. The DePaulia was not printed due to the sit-in and my desire to provide an opportunity to reach understanding. Discussions continue on all sides and at many levels to bring about the necessary understanding. We have put in place a professional journalist of color to work with The DePaulia staff on issues of both training and sensitivity. Some of the other initiatives that are under consideration and on which we have basic agreement are: To have at least one issue of the DePaulia devoted to the concerns of people of color. Working toward a better representation of color on the staff and management of the Depaulia. Discussing the boundaries between free expression and biased and insensitive journalism. Considering support for a regular section devoted to issues of people of color in each issue. Having better representation of people of color on the DePaulia Advisory Board. In regard to the university as a whole, we are very much a community. To date many of our staff and faculey, inciding those of colot, have been willing to engage in dialogue with all parties concerned. The key officers of the university have been deeply involved in this discussion. We are committed as a community to use education, discussion and negotiations to advance our understanding. These are the tools that a university should be using. We are in a search process for an Associate Vice President, who would serve as Special Assistant to the President for Multicultural Issues. This person will work within the university to achieve and implement programming and systemic change. There already is a university-wide Task Force on Multicultural Initiatives that is chaired by Dr. Jack Lane. This is an opportunity to heal hurt, build better understanding and change our system to better achieve the diversity we are all committed to reaching.

At the end of the day, I was left with the following: a great deal of respect for the student leadership that has come forth; the positive manner in which these students have joined together to raise these important issues; and that we share a commitment to moving forward. It is fitting, that on Cinco de Mayo day, a day that represents independence and understanding, that we join hands in working towards our continued commitment to address the concerns of our Latino/Latina students, and students of all cultures. It is important to not lose sight that the issues and concerns are shared by the entire University community. We must make sure that we do not focus on just one group. We must join forces to work on this agenda as a united community. Following several hours of heartfelt and productive conversation with the various alliances and other students I beard the following: serious concern about possible weakening of current and/or future multi-cultural initiatives, especially in the Latino/Latina area, through loss of trusted staff and unclear future programming support the abrupt personal loss and hurt felt by many Latino/Latina students resulting from the absence of trusted companions, allies and friends in the staff, leaving the feeling of no representation that, absolutely, these issues and actions were in no way meant to diminish or preempt other cultural view points, alliances, and/or trusts. In short, there is no African American vs. Latino/Latina conflict here. There is, in fact, mutual support for the advancement of all students' multi-cultural interests. In response to these concerns and demands it is my personal commitment to: First, given respect for confidentiality and employee rights, I personally will review croployment practices in the multi-cultural student affairs office. A complete and thorough review of all information will be made. Should weakness be found in this area, I will institute remedies to strengthen equal support, access and programming. Second, I will establish a permanent task force, the Multicultural Student TaskForce (MST), that will report regularly to the key administrative group within the University, the Joint Council, a group made up of myself, the Chancellor, the Senior Executive for Mission, the Executive Vice Presidents, Desus, Vice Presidents, and representation from the Faculty Council. The MST will be composed of leadership from the various student cultural alliances, as well as recommended faculty, and staff. The MST will be given the following charge: I. to review current climate issues among the student's as they relate to our University Community, II. to develop strategies to strengthen the University's commitment to diversity and multi-culturalism. III. to develop strategies to empower student leadership at DePaul for cross-cultural strength, awareness, and understanding. IV. to review continued commitment to student involvement in hiring initiatives including interview and selection processes. V. to regularly review operations with a continuing commitment to students satisfaction and student input. VI. to make a complete review of programs for retention and recruitment of students of diverse cultures, making recommendations for strengthening these programs.

The MST will be given the following charge: I. to review current climate issues among the student's as they relate to our University Community, II. to develop strategies to strengthen the University's commitment to diversity and multi-culturalism. III. to develop strategies to empower student leadership at DePaul for cross-cultural strength, awareness, and understanding. IV. to review continued commitment to student involvement in hiring initiatives including interview and selection processes. V. to regularly review operations with a continuing commitment to students satisfaction and student input. VI. to make a complete review of programs for retention and recruitment of students of diverse cultures, making recommendations for strengthening these programs. VII. to make a complete review of scholarship and funding programs for students of diverse cultures and make recommendations for strengthening these programs. VIII. to work with faculty structures to enhance curriculum in the area of multi-cultural learning. The MST will produce an initial report submitted to the Joint Council by Friday June 3, 1994, with continued updates and recommendations every other month.",607,0.022865854,0.019817073,0.007621951,0.016768293,0.041158537,0.038109756,0.007621951,0.446646341,0.022865854,0.016768293,0.025914634,0.013719512,0.013719512,0.028963415,0.099085366,0.007621951,0.108231707,0.010670732,0.028963415,0.022865854,0.089939024,0.044207317,0.588414634,0.277439024,5/5/94,"Sept.

We have lost so much – nothing less, in fact, than a part of ourselves. We have lost so many. We can count the numbers, but never the cost. For a grief like this, there are, really, no words – except those of him who said, “I am the resurrection and the life” (John 11: 25). Christ has promised, and his promise is our hope. To all those who have lost friends and loved ones, we extend our deepest sympathy. For them, for the injured, and for all who have died, we promise our prayer. We pray especially for those closest to us. With deep sorrow, I must ask you to remember the following members of our Seton Hall family lost on the 11th of September. There may be more, I am afraid, but this list is the most complete we have to-date.

In the meantime, our prayers and our efforts on behalf of the victims and in support of the relief effort will go on. Members of the University community already have been very generous with their time and their resources. An emergency fund has been established, and contributions may be sent to Campus Ministry, with checks made payable to Seton Hall Cares: WTC Relief Fund. Already the Seton Hall family has donated more than $7,500. We are doing what we can.

The intent will be to help advance thoughtful, creative dialogue: to enlighten, to educate, to seek avenues of response. Not coincidentally, the symposium will take place on the day the Church celebrates the feast of Saint Francis, that special apostle of peace.

82,shu4,11/8/08,Seton Hall University,Letter to the University Community,Message,Political CT,"Over the past several months, the turmoil in the world’s financial markets has deeply affected our nation’s families, workplaces, and institutions. This is especially true here in the New York metropolitan area and I think it would be helpful to share with you how the University is responding to these economic challenges. Seton Hall is certainly not immune from unsettling economic tides. The downturn in the nation’s investment and credit markets has affected our endowment returns, access to capital, and loans to our students. While the University’s endowment portfolio has grown significantly over these last ten years and our investment strategies have protected us from the worst of the “down side,” risk abounds and Seton Hall will continue to experience a reduction in interest and investment income. The Chronicle of Higher Education and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities have recently issued reports on how this economic crisis is, and likely will be, impacting higher education across the board. There is certainly some good news to report, as we entered this academic year with a set of notable accomplishments: completion of the new Science and Technology Center and a newly renovated Chapel, success of the $150 million Ever Forward campaign, implementation of campus-wide administrative and Web-based technology systems, implementation of our new Core Curriculum, initiatives that will increase our four-year graduation rate, and increasingly successful student recruitment and retention plans. We have lived within our means and, as a result, our rating agencies have recently confirmed our ability to meet these current economic challenges. (Indeed, Standard & Poor’s just raised our credit rating in September.) We will maintain this position through three key strategies: building upon our competitive strengths, reinforcing institutional accountability, and preparing for long-term economic recovery. All of us are aware that a Seton Hall education is a choice that often involves sacrifice for students and their families—even in good financial times. I am, therefore, asking the University’s senior leadership to develop financial strategies appropriate to the present economic situation, planning both proactively and conservatively. Seton Hall has long been marked by a healthy level of fiscal flexibility and we will need to do all we can to minimize rising costs and increasing debt burdens. I want you to know that our Executive Cabinet and our Regents will be carefully monitoring all we do to ensure that Seton Hall weathers the current and future storms safely. One of our chief priorities is to maintain Seton Hall’s competitive tuition. I can assure you that tuition rates and financial aid budgets will reflect our students’ increased need and that we will work closely with students who may have experienced sudden changes in their family’s financial circumstances. In addition, the University will seek to expand revenue sources and serve as wise stewards over current expenses. I have also asked University administrators to outline a series of response initiatives that will utilize existing resources to assist the University community during these challenging times. These will include academic programming initiatives as well as responsive strategies in student support services, human resources, alumni networking, career services, financial aid, and campus ministry. Seton Hall endeavors to foster a community where all can flourish—where opportunities abound and where goals and dreams can be realized. This will remain our goal even as we respond to our country’s difficult economic times. Wise choices, strong stewardship, the talent of our community, and focus on our Catholic mission will carry us through. Our motto, “Hazard zet Forward,” will prove, as always, to be powerfully true: in spite of the difficulties, Seton Hall University will surely forge ahead, together.",,Robert Sheeran,Male,12/1/95,4726,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Sept. 11 & Recession,1/1/93,12/31/11,Private religious,South Orange,NJ,Northeast,"Medium (3,000-9,999 FTE)",82,"Over the past several months, the turmoil in the world’s financial markets has deeply affected our nation’s families, workplaces, and institutions.

I am, therefore, asking the University’s senior leadership to develop financial strategies appropriate to the present economic situation, planning both proactively and conservatively. Seton Hall has long been marked by a healthy level of fiscal flexibility and we will need to do all we can to minimize rising costs and increasing debt burdens. I want you to know that our Executive Cabinet and our Regents will be carefully monitoring all we do to ensure that Seton Hall weathers the current and future storms safely. One of our chief priorities is to maintain Seton Hall’s competitive tuition. I can assure you that tuition rates and financial aid budgets will reflect our students’ increased need and that we will work closely with students who may have experienced sudden changes in their family’s financial circumstances. In addition, the University will seek to expand revenue sources and serve as wise stewards over current expenses. I have also asked University administrators to outline a series of response initiatives that will utilize existing resources to assist the University community during these challenging times. These will include academic programming initiatives as well as responsive strategies in student support services, human resources, alumni networking, career services, financial aid, and campus ministry. Seton Hall endeavors to foster a community where all can flourish—where opportunities abound and where goals and dreams can be realized. This will remain our goal even as we respond to our country’s difficult economic times. Wise choices, strong stewardship, the talent of our community, and focus on our Catholic mission will carry us through. Our motto, “Hazard zet Forward,” will prove, as always, to be powerfully true: in spite of the difficulties, Seton Hall University will surely forge ahead, together.",614,0.007418398,0.060830861,0.117210682,0.025222552,0.229970326,0.054896142,0.007418398,0.105341246,0.028189911,0.075667656,0.084569733,0.016320475,0.016320475,0.022255193,0.028189911,0.013353116,0.03115727,0.022255193,0.03115727,0.022255193,0.12611276,0.15578635,0.181008902,0.537091988,11/8/08,"Sept.

83,shu5,11/1/10,Seton Hall University,Update on Economic Challenges,Message,Political CT,"Last year at this time I updated you on the economic challenges we faced as we began formulating the operating budget for the current fiscal year. Declines in endowment, increased expenses and decreased revenue from almost every source required tough measures to ensure our fiscal stability while trying to maintain and improve the educational experience for all of our students. While we had hoped that the nation's economic situation would improve substantially, I can now report to you that colleges and universities across the country &mdash including Seton Hall &mdash are still feeling the effects of sluggish markets, unemployment, increased costs and decreased philanthropy. As you know, the University's cross-divisional Budget Working Group has been meeting for several months in anticipation of presenting the 2010-2011 budget to the Board of Regents in March. We recently met with the Board's leadership to discuss the preliminary results of the Group's work and it was clear that next year's budget is being constructed as prudently and conservatively as we have in the past. What was also clear, however, is that the University will be compelled to make painful cost-saving decisions as we move ahead, both in the short and long term. Long-term steps are already under way, most important among them the thoughtful process of strategic planning. Many of you have worked hard on the University's new plan, ""From Strength to Strength: Seton Hall 2015,"" and its six strategic directions will certainly lead us to further excellence. I can also report to you that a strategic operational and workforce analysis has been scheduled over the coming months. It will assess opportunities for efficiencies in all operational structures and programs and it will identify avenues for increased revenue as well as opportunities to restructure, streamline and plan effectively. In the short term, we envision the necessity of strategic cuts in spending, better control of overtime and stipends, and further restrictions on hiring. Last year, I was clear in stating that layoffs would be considered only as a last resort. We are beyond that point now. Increased hiring over the last several years, made in good faith as we looked forward to increased revenues that did not materialize, is simply unsustainable. We will address this situation. Let me assure you that any decision regarding a reduction in force will be consistent with University policy and our collective bargaining agreements. Already the Seton Hall community has offered substantial input on cost-saving and improvements that can be achieved at little or no cost. I have directed my Executive Cabinet to review every line item and purchase in their divisional budgets and, as always, to align their decisions with the University's strategic priorities. In my fifteen years as President, I have communicated with you in joyful and difficult times.

I feel it is important to share some of my own reflections with you this afternoon. * * * The words “fire” and “justice” appear together in only one verse of Scripture: O house of David, thus says the LORD: “Administer justice every morning; And deliver the person who has been robbed From the power of his oppressor, That my wrath may not go forth like fire And burn with none to extinguish it, Because of the evil of their deeds.” (Jeremiah 21:12) On this day, exactly eighteen months ago, all of us at Seton Hall were robbed. A senseless fire unjustly robbed the Caltabilota, Giunta and Karol families of their dear sons and brothers Aaron, Frank and John. So many were injured and robbed of so much, and we know that we have been forever changed. From that day to this, we have often come together in remembrance and hope, conscious of our loss, yet letting our faith offer us the hope of resurrection and renewal. And from that day to this, we have also placed our trust in the law enforcement investigators who have worked so hard to piece together what happened early on that January morning. If they were to do their work, we had to tap into resources of patience and endurance that most of us did not even know we had. And if their work was to bear fruit we would have to offer them our every assistance, but we would also have to wait upon their painstaking methods of research and investigation. Over these eighteen months, many have grown weary with the wait. Only three weeks ago, we sadly learned that the fire was the result of arson. It now seems imminent that charges may be brought against those who are responsible for so much of our sorrow and pain. As a faith-filled community, we long for healing. And as a community stung by senseless tragedy, we yearn for justice. Joe and Candy Karol, Aaron’s parents, wrote to me only yesterday and shared with me how painful all this waiting has been. “In our opinion,” they wrote, “there cannot be healing without recovery; and there cannot be full recovery without the responsible individuals being brought to justice.” To that end, we are once again calling upon those responsible, and anyone who has information about that night, to step forward. We feel sure that such long-awaited courage would usher forth in healing for us all, and that human justice would intermingle with the divine mercy upon which we all depend. As President, I know I speak for all of us when I say how grateful we are for the unflagging assistance of the law enforcement investigators. We keep them in our prayers.

The possibility of war raises individual and institutional issues that the AU community should contemplate. It is helpful to remind ourselves that American University has distinguished itself in a variety of ways in the two World Wars, the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, the Gulf War, and more recently, the tragedy of 9/11. Along with thousands of other citizens, AU students, faculty, staff, alumni, and trustees courageously served their country and many sacrificed their lives in these conflicts. During World Wars I and II, we provided our campus facilities for use in the war effort. Equally important, in all these conflicts, AU revealed the depth of its educational integrity in times of crisis by inquiring, listening, attirming, challenging, debating, discussing, and seeking greater understanding of the vital issues of world-changing events. There is a deeply personal dimension to these kinds of international conflicts. If war comes, some AU community members will be affected directly by their own involvement, or that of their families and friends, in military service. Many undergraduates will be dealing with the tremendous emotional impact of these dangerous entanglements for the first time (most were age six to nine during the last conflict, the 1991 Gulf Our Office of Campus Life-specifically, our counseling center, residence hall directors and assistants, international student services staff. and chaplains-are prepared to provide services to advise, assist, and comfort members of our student body, staff, or faculty. Professionals in the Office of Human Resources can also offer assistance. I urge members of our community to seek the benefits of these services, should the need arise. I remind you also that the university's Emergency Management Procedures outline specific steps for responding to risks and can be found on the AU Web page under Offices and Services/Risk Management/Emergency Preparedness. (It is also accessible through my.american.edu/Front Desk/In an Emergency/Emergency Preparedness). The result of hundreds of hours of consultations and review, this document has been used by other universities as a model for developing crisis procedures. Additionally, I will soon be sending a memo to the campus community outlining procedural issues related specifically to war-time emergencies. Beyond the individual, personal level, the impending conflict will also have a broad institutional impact. Just as we are enriched by the exceptionally diverse populations that comprise our global campus community, we are also challenged by the interactions of people, from the US and abroad, with very different perspectives on this war. The issues are complex, and as war approaches, the arguments on both sides have become more passionate. Is a war to overthrow Saddam Hussein justified? Is the threat immediate or distant? Can it be contained or not? Should the United States act with a coalition of other countries or only after the United Nations Security Council authorizes action? Will the defeat of Iraq provide more security in the Middle East or generate more terrorism? Is a democratic, federal Iraq possible after war, and what role should, could, or will the United States play? This is just a partial list of the many questions that are being debated, and which engage our students and faculty. erson commitsimple manters and they enterso a broad sommunio de enter, they must be sorted out amid the pressures of unpredictable actions and reactions that constitute the unsettling dynamics of major international conflicts. There is no better place than a university- and specifically this university-for confronting these issues, engaging in open dialogue, and increasing our understanding of them. For this reason, in the event of the outbreak of war, the primary commitment of American University will be to draw upon the rich resources of our faculty, staff and students in order to assure that the primary mission of teaching and learning goes forward. Under trying conditions, we will be called upon to embody the values that have distinguished this exceptional institution-freely expressing and exchanging ideas; respecting persons whose political views, religious commitments, national origins, or skin color differ from our own; promoting peace and conflict resolution; accepting the obligation to teach and learn in the remarkable array of classes, disciplines, and programs we offer on a daily basis; and, setting aside prejudgments and stereotypes, genuinely seeking grounds for common understanding. We are all rightly proud of the collective maturity demonstrated by the entire campus community in reaction to the events of 9/11. This maturity could be tested again in the weeks and months ahead. From the standpoint of campus security and other such concerns, we have worked steadily during the past two years to upgrade our institutional capacity for responding to emergencies and crises. As reported in earlier communications about our Emergency Management Procedures, this capacity includes strategic and technical expertise, physical security arrangements, communications and logistical abilities, evacuation protocols, staff training, and other measures that can be implemented to ensure, as much as humanly possible, the safety and welfare of the AU community. Unlike 9/11. we have been watching the buildup for this war for quite sometime. It has generated a large body of research, debate, and public discussion that can be utilized as part of our campus experience. Therefore, the university will encourage special sessions and events to tap into these resources-teach-ins, peaceful vigils, special lectures and presentations, panels, social and political commentary, and artistic expressions-all with the goal of sharing insights and information, examining our assumptions, increasing our understanding, and enriching the lives we share with each other on campus and with persons throughout the world. The nation and the world will be following the events of the days to come, hoping for a peaceful resolution to this international crisis. Should this not happen and war occurs, I urge you once again to embrace the proud AU tradition of finding ways to affirm the distinctive values of this special academic community. This tradition, built by successive generations of the American University family, has repeatedly and courageously displayed a profound understanding and affirmation of the irreducible dignity of every person. It is a tradition worthy of invoking in the campus activities and dialogues in which we will be engaged in the days ahead.

We are all rightly proud of the collective maturity demonstrated by the entire campus community in reaction to the events of 9/11. This maturity could be tested again in the weeks and months ahead. From the standpoint of campus security and other such concerns, we have worked steadily during the past two years to upgrade our institutional capacity for responding to emergencies and crises. As reported in earlier communications about our Emergency Management Procedures, this capacity includes strategic and technical expertise, physical security arrangements, communications and logistical abilities, evacuation protocols, staff training, and other measures that can be implemented to ensure, as much as humanly possible, the safety and welfare of the AU community. Unlike 9/11. we have been watching the buildup for this war for quite sometime. It has generated a large body of research, debate, and public discussion that can be utilized as part of our campus experience. Therefore, the university will encourage special sessions and events to tap into these resources-teach-ins, peaceful vigils, special lectures and presentations, panels, social and political commentary, and artistic expressions-all with the goal of sharing insights and information, examining our assumptions, increasing our understanding, and enriching the lives we share with each other on campus and with persons throughout the world. The nation and the world will be following the events of the days to come, hoping for a peaceful resolution to this international crisis. Should this not happen and war occurs, I urge you once again to embrace the proud AU tradition of finding ways to affirm the distinctive values of this special academic community. This tradition, built by successive generations of the American University family, has repeatedly and courageously displayed a profound understanding and affirmation of the irreducible dignity of every person. It is a tradition worthy of invoking in the campus activities and dialogues in which we will be engaged in the days ahead.

Upon receiving word of the events surrounding the World Trade Center Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, DC, we cancelled all classes and activities for the rest of the day and evening. Because of the clogged roads and the shutdown of all airline flights, we urged students to remain on campus, where we will continue to provide all necessary services. The campus entrances are closed to general traffic and campus security officers are screening all cars and walk-on traffic. Student leaders, university administrators and staff, and faculty joined me in visiting residence halls and classroom buildings to communicate what we know and provide assistance to concerned students and employees.

88,amu4,10/20/05,American University,Campus Update,Message,Campus CT,"On Monday, October 10, the American University Board of Trustees announced that Dr. Benjamin Ladner would not return as president of American University. He had been on administrative leave since August 24, pending the outcome of the board deliberations based on the audit of his travel and personal expenses. Since August, I have been acting president, a role that I have been asked to continue to fulfill until the Board completes a search and appoints a new president. As a long time member of the AU community, an AU alumnus, donor, and parent of an alumnus, I understand your desire for timely information about board activities that have implications for the entire community. The complexity of the matters before the board required confidential deliberations, which limited the information that was available to share with concerned parents, alumni and others. I realize that most of what you know probably came from the local or national news media. You may wish to add to our background information by browsing the AU web-pages, where statements released by the Board of Trustees and me are posted on the president’s web-page, and articles from campus publications such as the American Weekly and the Eagle are available online. Throughout this challenging situation, AU students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends have been exemplary in their support of American University. The board has responded and continues to respond to the campus voices as it looks to AU’s future. In the weeks ahead, the trustees will continue their efforts to conclude their inquiry and begin to address the questions this experience has raised about our institution’s governance. The audit and related discussions have dominated the board’s agenda for months and has been the focus of considerable public scrutiny. In responding to this complex matter and considerable pressures, the board has taken its fiduciary responsibilities very seriously, and continues to do so. This may be the first communication you have received directly from American University that addresses the events that have transpired. Based on the many letters and inquiries we have received, I am providing the following answers to frequently asked questions that I hope will add to your understanding of these events. Meanwhile, I can assure you that our values are intact, our principles are strong, and I appreciate your support of American University. Q. What was the focus of the board audit and the chain of events that ensued? A. The board received an anonymous letter alleging concerns about personal and travel expenditures of the AU president. The board responded by hiring independent auditors (Protiviti) and counsel (Arnold and Porter) to conduct an investigation into the president’s expenses. On August 24, the Executive Committee of the Board placed Dr. Ladner on administrative leave and I was named acting president. The full board met on September 12 to review the situation. On September 28, about half of the board met on campus with representatives from the faculty, staff, students, alumni, and academic leadership to gauge campus opinion. On October 10, the full board met again to reach closure on Dr. Ladner’s status. The board will continue its work until all matters related to the probe into the president’s expenses are resolved. Q. What outcomes were announced after the October 10 Trustees meeting? A. At the conclusion of the meeting, Board Vice Chair Thomas A. Gottschalk met with members of the campus community and announced the following actions: Dr. Ladner would not return as president. I would continue as acting president, until a search has been conducted and a new president named. The board adopted the findings of its audit committee and authorized the university to report additional taxable income for Dr. Ladner for the years 2002-2005 and to seek reimbursement from Dr. Ladner for certain personal expenses. The board expressed gratitude for the accomplishments of AU during Dr. Ladner’s tenure and for his service of during his 11 years as president. The board appointed three trustee committees: Search Process Committee – to meet with constituencies of the university and recommend an inclusive process for finding the next president; Board Nominating Committee – to consider candidates as the new board chair resulting from the resignation of former chair Leslie Bains; Board Governance Committee – to examine and recommend improvements of the board’s governance processes going forward. In addition to the formal board actions, two other events of note occurred. As noted above, Leslie Bains resigned both as chair and from the board prior to the Oct. 10 meeting; and trustee Paul Wolff resigned from the board after the meeting. The board will work to appoint a new chair in the next few weeks when the trustees reconvene for scheduled meetings. Q. What remains to be done? A. The board did not complete the work on the terms of Dr. Ladner’s separation. A committee will work on these details and make recommendations to the full board. Various campus constituencies have made their views known on what they consider to be the remaining issues. Q. Has this had an impact on campus operations and finances? A. The university’s senior leadership team responsible for academics and campus operations -- the acting provost, vice presidents, deans, and others – were not the focus of the inquiry, which was limited to the personal and travel expenses of the president. The audit focused on one particular office and involved a very small part of the university’s over all budget. One outcome of the audit that was that appropriately determined amounts will be reimbursed to the university. Q. What effect will this have on the reputation of American University? A. While these events have increased public scrutiny of American University, I am confident that we will soon move beyond these issues and continue to build on our successes. Regarding the potential impact on AU, an article in the October 21 Chronicle of Higher Education quoted two higher education experts on the matter. Shelden E. Steinbach, vice president and general counsel of the American Council on Education, said the controversy would have only “minimal” long-term negative consequences; and Thomas C. Longin, former vice president of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges and a current higher education consultant, commented “They (AU) will move forward very quickly. This is not an institution that’s very fragile.” Woven throughout the recent news stories was one consistent theme – that American University has made tremendous progress on numerous fronts, and that our reputation is “ascendant.” This is supported by the recent Middle States accreditation report, which is available for public review online. I am committed to moving AU forward with renewed vision, dedication to our educational mission, and focus on achieving success in the Campaign for AnewAU. I anticipate an emphasis on improving transparency to our alumni, students, faculty, parents, staff, and donors and will assist the board in their connections with the campus and community. I will continue the dialogue with students, parents, alumni, faculty, and staff to improve communication with all members of the AU community. Q. What role will members of the AU community have in selecting the new President and on the board? A. I expect that the search for a new president will engage all of American University’s constituencies. The Board of Trustees Board members were impressed with the voices they heard during their recent deliberations, and the board has an enhanced appreciation for our community’s love for this institution and interest in its well being.",https://web.archive.org/web/20090325094128/http://www.american.edu/president/statements/102005_1.html,Cornelius Kerwin,Male,8/24/05,57,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Republican,Sept. 11 & Recession,1/1/93,12/31/11,Private non-religious,Washington,DC,South,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",88,"On Monday, October 10, the American University Board of Trustees announced that Dr. Benjamin Ladner would not return as president of American University.

89,amu5,11/4/05,American University,Campus Update,Message,Campus CT,"Since the last time I wrote, a number of developments have brought strong reactions from the university community and continue to attract the attention of external interests and authorities. These matters have implications for our work, and their effects will be felt for the foreseeable future. They merit review. Following the board’s decision that Benjamin Ladner would not return as president of American University, the board announced a settlement agreement that was signed on October 24. Board vice chair Thomas Gottschalk met with representatives of a number of campus constituencies on that day and later that week to discuss the terms of the settlement and the board’s logic in endorsing the agreement. Terms of the agreement have been widely reported on campus, in the news media, and in other venues. Reaction to the settlement was immediate and generally negative. I need not recount the criticisms in detail, other than to state that both the basis and the specific terms of the agreement were questioned and disapproved in strong terms. The board responded to the criticism in a letter signed by vice chair Gottschalk and chair-elect Gary Abramson. They issued an apology to the community and going forward pledged a number of things, among them: . . . for the trustees to be less isolated and insulated from campus and have a better understanding of the concerns and priorities of all who work and learn here . . . . for improved and more inclusive governance . . . . for the board to be more vigilant with respect to financial matters . . . . to be more transparent in its discussions and decisions . . . . (and) to assure that the board itself, as a matter of leadership, reflects the values of this university in its work and processes. On November 1, chair-elect Abramson conducted a series of informal meetings with the acting provost and deans, the leadership and members of the Faculty Senate, student leaders, and the Staff Council to discuss concerns regarding the agreement and governance matters. On November 3, Matthew Pittinsky, who heads the board’s working group on the presidential succession, met with many of the same groups to get their views on the search process. These will likely be the first of many such meetings in the weeks and months to come. The board’s special committee on governance will be engaging the community, as well. As Tom Gottschalk and Gary Abramson noted in their memo to the campus: We hope . . . the ensuing dialogue with the community will be considered not only responsive to the faculty resolutions and student expressions of concern, but also to what we see as our responsibilities as trustees of this great university. One result of the board’s commitment to a new way of doing business is that they will be reaching out to the community in new and varied ways. I encourage everyone to be constructive as we test new ways to communicate viewpoints, exchange information, and be inclusive. This will eventually settle into regular communication patterns that are both effective and efficient. Please continue to work through your elected representatives to the extent possible and forward to them your ideas, concerns, and suggestions on any matter you consider relevant. In addition, a governance Web site has been established, www.american.edu/governance, and an e-mailbox for communicating to the board, aubot@american.edu. It is vitally important that the AU community use the opportunities presented by the board for interaction. I hope you do so in an informed manner and become familiar with “best practices” in university governance, to enable us to participate in meaningful ways in the ongoing discussions. For my part, I will convene a working group of representatives of the major university constituencies to serve as a clearinghouse on matters pertaining to governance. It will consist of the chair of the Faculty Senate or his designee, a representative of the student body, a dean, a vice president, President of the Alumni Board, a parent, and the chair of the Staff Council or her designee. In convening this group I am fully aware and strongly support the efforts already well underway in these individual constituencies on the issue of governance. This working group will in no way preempt those efforts or interfere with the ability of individual constituencies to communicate directly with the board. Instead, it is a forum to share and discuss ideas and may serve as a single stop for a comprehensive list of the ideas on governance that will be generated across the entire university. Once convened, the group will determine its own agenda and I will take no further part in their discussions, unless requested. The current controversy is not likely to abate soon. We all are aware of the letter from Senator Charles Grassley to the board vice chair. Throughout this period, our commitment to the core academic mission will not lag. We exist to create knowledge, to teach and learn, and to serve our varied communities. In each of these areas we have opportunities and challenges that deserve our best thought and concerted actions. At the same time, it is important that discussion and debate about future governance continue. This is expected in an institution with a deep commitment to academic freedom. While our attention may not be undivided, I have complete confidence that we are more than equal to the tasks at hand. I know, as do you, that over these past several months our accomplishments as a community have been substantial and, in some cases, truly remarkable. Our fundamental work continues, and continues at a very high level. I will write again soon and whenever events merit.

Once convened, the group will determine its own agenda and I will take no further part in their discussions, unless requested. The current controversy is not likely to abate soon. We all are aware of the letter from Senator Charles Grassley to the board vice chair. Throughout this period, our commitment to the core academic mission will not lag. We exist to create knowledge, to teach and learn, and to serve our varied communities. In each of these areas we have opportunities and challenges that deserve our best thought and concerted actions. At the same time, it is important that discussion and debate about future governance continue. This is expected in an institution with a deep commitment to academic freedom. While our attention may not be undivided, I have complete confidence that we are more than equal to the tasks at hand. I know, as do you, that over these past several months our accomplishments as a community have been substantial and, in some cases, truly remarkable. Our fundamental work continues, and continues at a very high level. I will write again soon and whenever events merit. In the meantime, accept my appreciation for your efforts on behalf of AU.",950,0.049516908,0.008454106,0.010869565,0.030193237,0.025362319,0.027777778,0.015700483,0.501207729,0.013285024,0.054347826,0.006038647,0.018115942,0.059178744,0.030193237,0.013285024,0.035024155,0.027777778,0.04468599,0.013285024,0.015700483,0.167874396,0.085748792,0.54589372,0.200483092,11/4/05,"Sept.

90,amu6,12/9/05,American University,Monthly Update,Message,Campus CT,"We approach the end of the fall semester, which has been one of the most momentous in the university's history. Before we are completely overtaken by work and holidays, I want to reflect on recent developments and what lies ahead in the coming months. For the first time, American University had finalists in both the Marshall and Rhodes scholarship competitions and also for the first time, two AU students were Rhodes finalists in the same year. Kyle Taylor and Forrest Dunbar, our two finalists, distinguished themselves and the university during the Rhodes competition. Natalie Hand is our first Marshall Scholar since 1995. We are proud of the remarkable accomplishments of these three students and we admire the discipline, drive and talent they displayed during the rigorous selection processes. We are equally proud of and we appreciate the faculty who taught and mentored them, along with the staff in the Office of Merit Awards and elsewhere who worked hard to prepare them. Activities continue related to board reform. On December 1, board chair Gary Abramson and vice chair Tom Gottschalk, with the assistance of counsel, submitted their response to the questions posed by Senator Charles Grassley on behalf of the Senate Finance Committee. Their letter was posted on both the governance and president's websites and I urge you to review it if you have not already. We will collect all comments regarding this posting and convey them to the board for review. We may receive additional communications from the senator and committee staff in the coming weeks and will inform the university community accordingly. There are other board activities related to governance that are important to note. This week, representatives of the board's Special Committee on Governance began a series of meetings with representatives of campus constituencies, including the vice presidents, interim provost and deans, Faculty Senate, students, alumni, staff and parents. Committee chair and trustee Pam Deese has provided a meetings summary that is posted on the governance Web site. These initial sessions were to obtain the university community’s views regarding needed reforms in current governance structures and processes, and other meetings will follow. I urge all members of the AU community to work through your units or elected representatives to make your views known. The working group of representatives from each of our major constituencies is available as a clearinghouse for sharing ideas and information. Should campus organizations need assistance in obtaining information on governance practices, please notify my office and we will see that the appropriate resources are made available. Over the past few months, a number of persons have asked questions about the university’s financial status and our internal management controls. This is understandable in light of recent events, and these questions merit a serious and detailed response that space here does not allow. But, let me state a few pertinent facts and outline subsequent planned communications. At the November 2005 board meeting, the Audit Committee heard the report from KPMG, our external auditor. KPMG issued an unqualified opinion on the university’s financial statements, which is their highest rating. They also reported there were no material weaknesses in internal controls. The committee also heard from our internal auditor, Protiviti (the firm engaged by the board for its inquiry into the expenses of the former president), on its progress to date on a project related to the university's internal management and controls. At the fall 2004 board meeting, the Audit Committee approved an internal audit plan, which includes using a significant portion of internal audit’s time to begin a Sarbanes-Oxley review of the university’s internal controls over financial processes. Although the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations do not apply to not-for-profit institutions, the Audit Committee agreed with management that AU should continue to be proactive in applying rigorous standards of internal control across the enterprise. This began an 18-month process during which Protiviti has been reviewing, documenting, and performing detailed testing of the university’s internal controls. To date, Protiviti has reviewed and documented the following processes and found no significant internal control weaknesses: procurement and accounts payable; payroll and benefits; investments and cash management; and auxiliary services. Additional reviews are currently underway in areas such as registration, student accounts, financial aid, and overall financial reporting. Vice president of finance Don Myers will report on the strong overall financial state of the university and the condition of financial controls at either the January or February meeting of the Faculty Senate, whose meetings are open to the university community. (The exact date will be determined when the Faculty Senate agenda for the spring semester is set). Our budget performance for the current fiscal year with regard to revenue and expenditures requires monitoring over the coming months. Revenue from summer and fall enrollments is expected to fall short of the budget, and spring enrollment revenue is likely to be short of target as well. However, we have budgeted prudently regarding our tuition reserves, other areas of revenue appear satisfactory, and our management of expenditures appears on track. We will monitor this carefully, but as of now, I see no reason to alter the plans for the current year. Looking ahead, we are on the cusp of the most important period in the next round of student recruitment. As of this week, the early decision pool looks strong and applications for 2006 fall enrollment for freshmen and transfers are up over this time last year. Masters applications are running behind this time last year, but we are still early in the cycle. As I announced to campus on November 1, Al Checcio will leave his position as vice president of university relations on December 31 to assume that same position at Fordham University. After extensive discussions with Al regarding his area of responsibility and the current challenges we face, I am making a number of organizational changes. First, the Department of Athletics and Recreation will report directly to me. This is the general practice in the Patriot League and increasingly throughout higher education. Second, the university-wide communications functions that were housed in Al's division, University Marketing and Publications, will be moved to David Taylor in the President’s Office. This consolidation will promote greater consistency in university-wide messages, while assisting the campus units in communicating their accomplishments to external media and other interested parties. David already oversees Media Relations, Special Events, and WAMU 88.5 FM. These changes are effective immediately. The core development functions -- research, major gifts, annual fund, alumni relations -- will remain intact and work closely with their counterparts in the schools and colleges. Ms. Abbey Silberman, currently director of prospect research and stewardship, will become senior director of development and serve as acting director of development. She will continue to oversee the critical research function, as well as the core development duties of the office. Abbey came to AU in 2004 with more than 15 years of experience in development and major gifts consulting which included work with Marts & Lundy (a non-profit consulting firm), Combined Jewish Philanthropies in Boston, and Harvard University. This change is effective January 1. It is critical that we maintain momentum on the Campaign for AnewAU. I will devote a significant portion of my time to development activities and work closely with Ms. Silberman, the deans and their directors of development to ensure that our resources in this area are used to best effect. As we end the semester, I thank every member of the AU community for maintaining high standards in all areas of this university's mission. We have endured change, levels of conflict and intense public scrutiny that few institutions experience. We have shown ourselves to be strong, resilient, and driven by a deep commitment to this institution. Throughout it all, our faculty members have pursued their scholarship, teaching, and professional activities; our students have continued to learn and grow; our staff have supported these activities; and we have continued to serve our many communities. We remain focused on ensuring that American University is true to its mission. For that I thank and commend you.

93,nwu3,3/22/04,Northwestern University,American Primacy,Remarks,Political CT,"A debate has been joined in the United Sates on America's role in the world. This debate started with the end of the Cold War and was brought to a head by the events of September 11, 2001; and then by America's response, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq. It has been a debate fueled by President Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy document, which has been understood to stress. 1) The USA must maintain unchallenged power, 2) A US willingness to act militarily preemptively, if need be. Preemptive and preventive wars are sometimes used interchangeably. The distinction in my mind is you act in one set of cases just as you know you are about to be attacked. In the other set of cases, attack is not imminent and, 3) unilaterally, if so desired. The costs of the Iraq war; the messiness of both Iraq's and Afghanistan's reconstruction during the post-open combat phase and the absence of key European allies in Iraq, all have sharpened the debate, as has the putative lack of legitimacy, given the absence of United Nations support for the Iraq war. Whether we will get more heat than light in an election year, remains to be seen. I want to focus my discussion around what I and others have called the issue of American primacy and I want to bring this home to conflicts in the Middle East. First, however, if you give me leave, l'd like to take you on a whirlwind tour of the precursors of present debates. From the end of World War II, until the 1980's US foreign policy makers, and, for the most part, the informed public, saw the world through a prism of security concerns. The national interest was seen largely in terms of national security: nuclear threats to the US itself and Soviet military threats in Europe plus a growing Chinese power in Asia. As the United States' share of world product fell with the post-World War Il recovery of European economies and the growth of Japan and other Asian economies, it is true that the threat to the US began more and more to be defined in economic terms especially by the late 1970's and early 1980's. Trade and jobs and growth were seen as more tied to the world economy and in the 1980's US commentators became obsessed by the Japanese economic challenge. The US went from a creditor to debtor nation very rapidly during the Reagan presidency and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker's high interest rate policy. As the Soviet Union weakened and then collapsed in the late 1980 s and early 1990's, the threat perception became a different one. There was an expansion of foreign policy first order concerns; economic issues loomed large; the luxury of bringing in human rights issues occurred; and environmental issues came to the fore. President Bush came to office in context of the Clinton Administration's shift away from defining the national interest in narrow security terms. At the start of the Bush Administration, there was a concern with a rising China, with regional instability, especially in North East and South West Asia and the Middle East and there were plenty of people around President Bush and Vice President Cheney who were concerned with a virulent strain of Islam. However, President Bush eschewed nation building involvements in his campaign and he soon asserted a suspicion of treaties-the International Criminal Court, Kyoto, arms treaties. He also was willing to push NATO membership to new states who had been in the old Soviet sphere of influence and even to constituent former members of the Soviet Union. In other words, he had already asserted a unilateralism of sorts, before September 11. Then came September 11 and the nation was shocked back into more narrow definitions of security concerns, this time with a focus on the US Homeland Security; Islam, the Middle East, and Southwest Asia. But to reassert my point, the Bush administration was not an administration which came to power bent for great global changes, or at least the President was not, nor was Secretary Powell. The administration had stepped away from trying to broker an Israeli-Arab peace agreement. It seemed uninterested in pursuing an accommodation with North Korea; although, there were splits within the administration on this issue. The Bush administration was critical of the Clinton's administration's policy of engagement with the North Koreans. You will recall that the first major flap of the administration was with China, which appeared to it as a rising power and a competitor. Its attitude toward China was traditional in that it operated inside a realist context a worry about powerful nation states.a September 11 changed a great deal. The Bush administration soon after asserting its right to take unilateral, preventive action against terrorists and the states which harbored them-dusted off strategies and strategic documents that had been written in the time of the first President Bush, and formulated in the then Secretary of Defense Chaney's office and which were associated with Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Pearle and Scooter Libby, among others. These documents stated a desire and necessity for preemption and military dominance. And, these ideas were elaborated within the context of the administration's unilateralist bent. After Sept. 11, there was initially no desire to embrace NATO's military support in Afghanistan, when offered, or to help protect our Homeland, when offered. Later, the administration's willingness, if not desire to go it relatively alone vis-a-vis Iraq became clear. Of course, the Bush administration has not been unilateral in all foreign policy areas. Vis-à-vis North Korea, the US has insisted on multi-party negotiations and many of the same state actors who have criticized the Bush Administration for acting largely on its own, have wanted it to enter into two-party negotiations with North Korea. The Bush Administration has talked of coalitions of the willing, a more fluid and ad hoc grouping of states, and has been quite willing to deal with the French and Canadians, most recently in Haiti. It has acceded, again recently, to European allies stances vis-à-vis Iran's nuclear programs. And it has been looking for UN help in Iraq now and for other countries to foot more of the bill and to provide security in that country. In part, reality has imposed itself; in part, the Bush Administration can be opportunistic, also. I cannot know fully what motivated different actors in the Bush administration; though, there is a new book, the The Rise of the Vulcans: Bush's War Cabinet, by James Mann, which I have not read, that deals with such motive as does a recent book by James Lindsay and Ivo Daalder, America Unbound. Undoubtedly, there were some who saw September 11 as a chance to build a political base for sweeping change vis-à-vis enemies the axis of evil states. There were some who believed that it was/is simply better to fight terrorism abroad; to be proactive and preemptive and preventative. Some saw a chance to get at weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and warn Iran, Libya, North Korea, maybe even Pakistan on this issue. Some saw furthering an Arab/Israeli settlement by taking out Saddam. This was ""the way to Jerusalem runs through Baghdad"" argument, an argument also made at the time of the first Gulf war. Some saw a chance to shake up the Middle East; start change in Syria, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, an argument associated with Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami. This was revolutionary change, indeed, as Tom Friedman has noted. The National Security Document states some objectives that no one could disagree with: defend the peace; preserve the peace; encourage democracy. It stresses the economic, military and political strength of the USA. It sees the USA as a benevolent hegemon or leader. However, while it sees benefits from multilateral action, it stresses that US interest and responsibilities may require unilateral action, including preventive action, usually through intelligence and homeland defense but also through preemptive military action. It also states the need for the US to maintain military primacy to deter foreign military threats. The most aggressive proponents of the Bush doctrine believe that, if you are a superpower, you use your power to intimidate and get compliance and expand the American perimeter. But what does this mean? Does it mean for example that we should try to extend liberal democracy to Iran, Syria, and where else, if we do see positive outcomes in Iraq? I think pest Iraq, the American public and probably most American policy makers have little appetite for another major intervention. Iraq would have to turn out very well, better than it looks, though I grant it is early, for the US to take on interventions, if this means occupation and reconstruction in Syria, much less Iran, Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan if the last two should turn even worse for US interests. Americans are increasingly worried about limits, overstretch militarily and economically, and whether the United States has a culture for nation building, or even any highly developed civilian cadres for the job given the paucity of trained foreign service or USAID officers with Arab, Pushtun, Farsi. Let us now look at some facts concerning primacy... What does primacy mean given these facts? And here, I have a great problem with the unilateralists. Yes, we have something like military primacy. But in two clear and critical areas, neither conventional nor nuclear military primacy is determinative. First, there are other nuclear powers today, and many more than there were twenty years ago. One of these, North Korea, is relatively new and its nuclear weapons may already restrain and constrain, if not deter. In fact, its ye conventional forces have done the same heretofore. The Soviet Union may be gone, but a weaker and smaller Russia could still carry out vast en destruction with nuclear weapons. So could China, or for that matter, Pakistan. Second, terrorists cannot easily be deterred, as many writers note, because we cannot easily retaliate against them militarily. Afghanistan was an aberration. Most states, including ones who support terrorism, will not be so clear about giving safe harbors to open terrorists. Neither by aims nor address are terrorists militarily deterrable. Nor is taking the fight to terrorists, as President Bush again stated, as he once again defended our Iraq policy, easy to do and perhaps is not effective by conventional military means. Do we next move onto places we know have, one way or the other, supported terrorists or do we leave them alone: Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon. I say this as a supporter of the Iraq war. Maybe it will all work out; I believe it is too soon to say, but so far, few anti-terrorists goals have been achieved. And, in the short-run, I do not believe they could be achieved even with a more successful postwar reconstruction of Iraq, than seems likely at present. Economically, we simply do not have primacy or anything like it in this world. Our hope to get other countries to support the reconstruction of Iraq is only one indication. We are a debtor nation. We cannot compel China to revise its currency policy or get Europe to change its agricultural subsidy policies. We are a huge and powerful economy. But our shares of world trade and product do not allow us to use the term primacy to describe the United States' economic position. As Joe Nye pointed out, the term ""empire"" does not apply well to us. We do not determine either domestic or foreign policies even of countries that need us badly and where we have had much influence. He cites Mexico. I could cite the Republic of Korea, or maybe where I am speaking, among many others. On coalitions, allies, and using multilateral institutions-I'm a pragmatist. I do not think the coalition should determine the mission. I agree on this with Charles Krauthammer. But the mission is influenced by the coalition. We have to at times compromise. We often do. And we should compromise for practical reasons, not for the ideology of multilaterialism. But whatever one thinks of multilateral institutions, treaties, legal frameworks, if many others care about them and the values they represent, they become facts on the ground. I'm with Tony Blair when he says that coalitions are needed for winning the peace in Iraq, for cooperation against terrorism, and for burden sharing. I believe neo-conservatives will end up in the same place as pragmatic realists here. The Bush administration is already under-funding the reconstruction of Iraq, Afghanistan, and its promise on HIV/AIDS in Africa. And, we are trying to do all this and cut taxes! I do not believe in an American moment in history. Yes, we have a responsibility like no other country. Yes, we are an indispensable nation, an essential one, for ourselves and many other nations. But our moment has to be a shared one. The biggest policy challenge for American policy is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states and those movements to whom these states and others may sell or distribute the weapons of mass destruction. Preemption may indeed be called for here. If so, we need others to understand and support what we will do. If they do not understand, we will still act for our own security. The paradox is that the neo-Wilsonians have become of the right, not the left. They perceive values as self-evident when they are not. They have no patience with persuasion; and, this leads to bad policy. I am not saying the Bush administration did not try to persuade on Iraq. It did. But it set itself up for failure by earlier unilateral and unnecessary actions and policies in a number of arease- A further point. We have a superb professional army. But we do not have a professional overseas civil service. Willy nilly, we will do nation building-But we farm it out too much to large contractors, the beltway organizations, and some universities; and, by default, our military winds up doing civilian tasks in Iraq. We need to build the language capacity, and knowledge of culture and politics and economies essential for an in-house set of civilian administrators who can work overseas, especially in the Middle East and Central Asia. If we are an essential nation, we need to better staff our overseas duties. And I include our clandestine services here also. What implications do I draw for our policies in the Middle East? First, as I have said, I see no inclination for a further large scale military intervention, at least with ground forces, in the Middle East. I could envision this military invasion to secure oil fields, if need be, but not fo for occupying the seat of government in Damascus or anywhere else. I could envision the destruction of nuclear facilities, if one knew how to get at them, if they fall into wrong hands. But neither military nor economic wherewithal suggest a replay of Iraq. There would be little political support for such an intervention. Second, the United States has a deep interest in a settlement between lsrael and Palestinians. Its policies in Iraq and the rest of the Islamic world will always be questioned without such a settlement and maybe even with it. That Saddam or, for that matter, Osama, came late to Palestine issues does not negate what I said. The failure to have a settlement here weakens the US ~e in the Middle East. But the US does not know how to compel such a settlement. It may know the outline it wants but not how to bring it about. I would say the same for the India-Pakistan settlement in Kashmir. The actors on the ground will remain the key actors, not outsiders. These intractable regional conflicts have consequences beyond the regions themselves and for the United States.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qqfLD_EIwbDGL8MGg0iQhqpF8XqCoEZ0KKEkpG8rqcg/edit?tab=t.gmeoi4cyhtu3,Henry Bienen,Male,1/1/95,3368,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Republican,Sept. 11 & Recession,1/1/93,12/31/11,Public,Chicago,IL,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",93,"A debate has been joined in the United Sates on America's role in the world.

94,nwu4,10/17/08,Northwestern University,Message to Community on Economy,Message,Campus CT,"I'm sure that many of you have been following the recent economic news very closely. Clearly, economic fluctuations of this magnitude affect Northwestern, just as they affect all of us individually. Fortunately, Northwestern entered this period of uncertainty in a very strong financial position. That financial strength is the result of sound management, generous gifts from donors and good investment strategies. Northwestern's endowment has grown significantly in recent years, but like all endowments, has been hurt recently by the market's steep decline. However, because the policy we employ for determining how much money from the endowment we spend each year also considers the average portfolio over time, inflation, budget needs and other factors, the impact of the marketŐs performance is moderated to some extent. We are now taking prudent steps to ensure that our finances can continue to support our academic and research activities. We are consulting with the Board of Trustees, deans and school and area budget managers as we begin our budget planning for next year. As part of that, we will look very closely at any incremental costs, and we are not likely to add new faculty or staff positions. We also will review carefully the budgets for planned capital projects. We will continue to meet with other groups across the University in the next few weeks as we consider specific measures that Northwestern might take. At the same time, we are not planning any personnel reductions other than those that normally occur, such as when a funding grant expires. In the meantime, applications for undergraduate admission are running well ahead of last year's record pace. While it's still early in the admissions cycle, applications to both the law school and Kellogg also are expected to increase this year. We don't know yet how the economy will affect financial aid requests or the ability of students to obtain loans in the coming year, but Northwestern remains committed to providing the necessary financial assistance so all of our students, even those with great financial need, can afford to come to Northwestern. For most people, the major economic upheaval that we're now experiencing understandably creates a feeling of uneasiness. We cannot control the national and international economic forces that are sweeping through our financial institutions. But we can consider thoughtfully the potential impacts and plan accordingly, and I assure you that we're doing just that. In its 157-year history, Northwestern University has weathered some very difficult economic times, from the lean years following its founding to the dot-com bust earlier this decade. Through all of those times, the University has remained a citadel of teaching, research and scholarship.

Clearly, economic fluctuations of this magnitude affect Northwestern, just as they affect all of us individually. Fortunately, Northwestern entered this period of uncertainty in a very strong financial position. That financial strength is the result of sound management, generous gifts from donors and good investment strategies. Northwestern's endowment has grown significantly in recent years, but like all endowments, has been hurt recently by the market's steep decline. However, because the policy we employ for determining how much money from the endowment we spend each year also considers the average portfolio over time, inflation, budget needs and other factors, the impact of the marketŐs performance is moderated to some extent. We are now taking prudent steps to ensure that our finances can continue to support our academic and research activities. We are consulting with the Board of Trustees, deans and school and area budget managers as we begin our budget planning for next year. As part of that, we will look very closely at any incremental costs, and we are not likely to add new faculty or staff positions. We also will review carefully the budgets for planned capital projects. We will continue to meet with other groups across the University in the next few weeks as we consider specific measures that Northwestern might take. At the same time, we are not planning any personnel reductions other than those that normally occur, such as when a funding grant expires. In the meantime, applications for undergraduate admission are running well ahead of last year's record pace. While it's still early in the admissions cycle, applications to both the law school and Kellogg also are expected to increase this year. We don't know yet how the economy will affect financial aid requests or the ability of students to obtain loans in the coming year, but Northwestern remains committed to providing the necessary financial assistance so all of our students, even those with great financial need, can afford to come to Northwestern. For most people, the major economic upheaval that we're now experiencing understandably creates a feeling of uneasiness. We cannot control the national and international economic forces that are sweeping through our financial institutions. But we can consider thoughtfully the potential impacts and plan accordingly, and I assure you that we're doing just that. In its 157-year history, Northwestern University has weathered some very difficult economic times, from the lean years following its founding to the dot-com bust earlier this decade. Through all of those times, the University has remained a citadel of teaching, research and scholarship.

On Saturday at Dance Marathon I got to watch more than a thousand sweaty, happy and very tired students raise nearly a million dollars to benefit the Children’s Heart Foundation and the Evanston Community Foundation.

This open exchange of ideas and perspectives is key to the university experience, because it is one of the ways that we learn to think critically and reconsider our basic assumptions. After more than a year of primarily virtual engagement, the moment has come to remind ourselves of our responsibilities as a public university to support academic freedom and freedom of expression. Stony Brook University is dedicated to open inquiry, knowledge, and insight. As such, free speech and peaceful assembly are fundamental to our mission. True freedom of expression demands that we acknowledge the rights of others to hold and express beliefs different from our own. So often this is easier said than done. Inevitably we will encounter speech we believe to be abhorrent, biased, or false. In keeping with our mission and values, we have the right to meet such expressions with a clear and persuasive response, but never with acts that restrain the speech of others. Our Statement of Community clearly articulates our shared responsibility: “In committing ourselves to study and work at Stony Brook, we agree to promote equality, civility, caring, responsibility, accountability, and respect. We also recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating our differences and similarities.” The resources listed here set forth University policies and information that pertain to free speech and expression. The Frequently Asked Questions page on our dedicated “Free Speech” website offers further guidance. If you have additional questions, I invite you to direct them to freespeech@stonybrook.edu.

102,sbu6,3/20/17,Stony Brook University,Anti-Immigration Rhetoric Is a Threat to American Leadership,Press,Political CT,"America’s universities are the best in the world. The quality of the students, faculty, teaching, infrastructure, the commitment to academic freedom, and the extraordinary research opportunities attract the best and brightest people from around the globe to the United States. And our nation is far better for it. Last year six recipients of the Nobel Prize were working at American universities: the three winners of the prize in physics, the two winners in economics, and one of the three winners in chemistry. All six were foreign born. Bob Dylan was the only Nobel laureate last year born in the United States. And 2016 was no fluke. In all, 42 percent of the Nobel Prizes awarded between 1901 and 2015 went to individuals working/living in the United States, and nearly one third of those recipients were born outside the U.S. Our ability to attract the world’s leading scientists to our universities has helped us maintain global leadership in innovation and discovery, a tremendous component of our economic strength and national security. But it is not just faculty that have come to U.S. universities to pursue their research. We also have been the destination of choice for outstanding graduate and undergraduate students from around the world. At Stony Brook University and many other top research universities, the majority of our graduate students in STEM fields are international students. Many of these talented students stay on after their education and become contributors to innovation and economic development in our country. The economic impact of international students on the U.S. economy was nearly $36 billion dollars in 2015, with $4 billion in New York State alone. Just on my campus, roughly 10 percent of the startup companies at our business incubator are led by foreign born scientists with much of the workforce coming from recent international doctoral students. And the impact of international students on our campus is not just economic, they add to the diversity of culture and ideas on our campus, broadening the experience of every student at Stony Brook University and better preparing them for the 21st century world. But now this is all at risk. New immigration policies, coupled with xenophobic rhetoric and actions both before and after the election, are undoing the compact between the United States and those seeking opportunity from around the world. The first executive order nearly resulted in the deportation of the President of Stony Brook’s Graduate Student Organization, a former Fulbright Scholar, who had been studying in the United States for 10 years. The campus was dramatically unsettled, with an initial loss of the sense of security and welcoming inclusive environment that we have worked so hard to establish. And the impact is not just local. Research universities are seeing an immediate effect on the recruitment of international faculty and students. Stony Brook University has seen a decline of roughly 10 percent in international applications for graduate school this year, a figure that seems to be on a par with the decline seen at other institutions. The reasons for these declines may not be solely based on anti-immigration policies and rhetoric, but some accepted applicants to Stony Brook, especially from countries targeted by the first Executive Order, have stated explicitly that they will choose a Canadian or Australian university instead, based on the uncertainty of U.S. immigration policy and the fact that they are being singled out based on their country of origin, not on their academic credentials. And the recent suspension of expedited processing of H1-B visas, which is of significant concern to the Technology Sector, could also have a chilling effect on the ability of Universities to attract outstanding international faculty and scientists to help sustain our research and educational missions. Rather than creating pathways to citizenship like DACA, the anti-immigration rhetoric, and now acts of violence against immigrants to the United States, is sending a message to the world that the United States, and by implication, our universities, no longer will be a welcoming and safe environment for international students and faculty. “They” should look elsewhere, and, unfortunately for us, they will. It may not be too late to make this right. Policy needs to be based on facts, not fear. Recent data from Homeland Security on the relative risks posed by recent immigrants to the U.S. vs those who have been residents for years should be incorporated into our approach to security. Continuing DACA and moving to a policy that “staples a Green Card” on to the diploma of graduates of U.S. universities would go a long way to helping address our workforce issues in technology and reassuring the world that we do still want best and the brightest to study and work in the United States of America. Our embrace of international students and faculty has given the U.S. a leg up on all other countries in the race to lead in innovation and discovery. We augment our extraordinary homegrown talent with future leaders from around the world. But time is short, the new policies and rhetoric are taking their toll, significant damage is being done, and if we surrender our global edge in innovation and discovery, we may never get it back.",https://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/guest-blog/anti-immigration-rhetoric-is-a-threat-to-american-leadership/,Samuel Stanley,Male,7/1/09,2819,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Republican,Trump & Racial Justice,1/1/12,12/31/22,Public,Stony Brook,NY,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",102,"America’s universities are the best in the world.

103,gmu1,1/18/21,George Mason University,Reflecting on Dr. King's determination and resolve,Message,Political CT,"This holiday weekend overflows with irony. When I think of any march on Washington, the image that immediately comes to mind is that of Martin Luther King Jr., arguably America’s greatest leader of non-violent social change, at the base of the Lincoln Memorial. Contrast that with the images of the more than 25,000 soldiers who currently occupy our capital as a direct result of what former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund described as a “violent attack … unlike any I have experienced in my 30 years in law enforcement here in Washington, D.C.” This irony creates many more questions than answers: How did a protest that was supposed to dispute an election get corrupted with guns, multiple Confederate flags, and racists and anti-Semitic slogans? The lack of a meaningful outcry from the protestors and their supporters that these elements did not represent their ideals left many to believe the protestors were in support of the vandalism, hatred and anti-American symbols and sentiments. It’s really illuminating that these were some of the very issues that King fought against. How can we make sense of a nation that suddenly needs 25,000 troops in its capital just to safeguard the peaceful transition of power from one president to the next? Is there really an equivalency between the protest in Washington, D.C. this summer following the deaths Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, and the protest on January 6th? Did law enforcement treat these entities as equivalent? And how on earth do we make sense of this at a time when we are supposed to be reflecting and taking meaningful action toward nonviolent social advancement? I have found inspiration in the teachings of Dr. King himself, particularly from his Letter From Birmingham City Jail. He wrote it in 1963 as he sat in solitary confinement, having been arrested for peacefully protesting the oppressive segregation of Bull Connor’s Birmingham. He is described as having felt despair and panic in his isolation. It is evident that many Americans share this sentiment today whether they are protesting police brutality or the election results. During King’s incarceration, a sympathetic guard smuggled him a newspaper, which contained a scathing open letter to him from eight local clergy, who condemned him as an “extremist,” and his protests as “unwise and untimely.” Out of his despair, he regained resolve and penned his now-immortal response. Three points in particular resonate with me on this weekend, and I invite you to reflect on them, as well: Reject violence, no matter what. In his letter, he described how he and his fellow protestors had to steel themselves for the violence they knew their peaceful protests would draw out. He would tell them: “We adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself."" King goes further to remind us that, “Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” These statements were lessons for his followers at that time but are equally true in this moment. Progress toward social justice is not automatic. “Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability,” Dr. King wrote from his jail cell. It takes constant work and the effective use of time. “We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. … Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.” As we prepare to inaugurate a new president, we have reached a moment of sobering national reckoning about who we have been, who we are, and therefore, in time, who we might become. Just as we were told after each mass shooting over the last decade that “now is not the time” to address the root causes of gun violence in America, Dr. King was chided that his social movement was “untimely.” Waiting was always the advice he would receive, and thankfully reject. We were not ready for the events of January 6. We as a nation will never be ready, or be comfortable, with the gut-wrenching truths that these events and the social justice events of 2020 now demand that we examine. It is time to stop waiting until we are “ready,” because such a comfortable moment will never present itself. We are all extremists. Dr. King initially bristled at being called out as an “extremist.” Then he thought more deeply about it and concluded that anyone who believes wholly in their cause will be characterized as an extremist. And so, he embraced his mantle as an extremist for love, justice, and equality. “So, the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be,” he wrote. “Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?” So, Patriots, in keeping with this holiday as a day “on” and not a day “off,” here is a homework assignment for all of us: How can we be extremists for love and the extension of justice? Because today is ripe to do right.",https://president.gmu.edu/news/2021-01/reflecting-dr-kings-determination-and-resolve,Gregory Washington,Male,7/1/20,201,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Trump & Racial Justice,1/1/12,12/31/22,Public,George Mason,VA,South,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",103,"This holiday weekend overflows with irony.

During King’s incarceration, a sympathetic guard smuggled him a newspaper, which contained a scathing open letter to him from eight local clergy, who condemned him as an “extremist,” and his protests as “unwise and untimely.” Out of his despair, he regained resolve and penned his now-immortal response. Three points in particular resonate with me on this weekend, and I invite you to reflect on them, as well: Reject violence, no matter what. In his letter, he described how he and his fellow protestors had to steel themselves for the violence they knew their peaceful protests would draw out. He would tell them: “We adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself."" King goes further to remind us that, “Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” These statements were lessons for his followers at that time but are equally true in this moment. Progress toward social justice is not automatic. “Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability,” Dr. King wrote from his jail cell. It takes constant work and the effective use of time. “We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. … Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.” As we prepare to inaugurate a new president, we have reached a moment of sobering national reckoning about who we have been, who we are, and therefore, in time, who we might become. Just as we were told after each mass shooting over the last decade that “now is not the time” to address the root causes of gun violence in America, Dr. King was chided that his social movement was “untimely.” Waiting was always the advice he would receive, and thankfully reject. We were not ready for the events of January 6. We as a nation will never be ready, or be comfortable, with the gut-wrenching truths that these events and the social justice events of 2020 now demand that we examine. It is time to stop waiting until we are “ready,” because such a comfortable moment will never present itself. We are all extremists. Dr. King initially bristled at being called out as an “extremist.” Then he thought more deeply about it and concluded that anyone who believes wholly in their cause will be characterized as an extremist. And so, he embraced his mantle as an extremist for love, justice, and equality. “So, the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be,” he wrote. “Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?” So, Patriots, in keeping with this holiday as a day “on” and not a day “off,” here is a homework assignment for all of us: How can we be extremists for love and the extension of justice? Because today is ripe to do right.",891,0.036989796,0.151785714,0.06505102,0.016581633,0.014030612,0.034438776,0.011479592,0.047193878,0.019132653,0.021683673,0.019132653,0.350765306,0.014030612,0.044642857,0.008928571,0.036989796,0.021683673,0.021683673,0.039540816,0.024234694,0.292091837,0.103316327,0.446428571,0.158163265,1/18/21,"Trump &

Our ability to discover scientific breakthroughs, invent disruptive technologies and build successful companies that make those advances broadly available has been unparalleled. This creativity is the product of a culture that is uniquely open to new ideas, that encourages and rewards risk taking, that values people for what they achieve, not where they come from. It is also the result of a constant supply of talented people from outside the United States, many of whom came to this country seeking world-class education and an open society where they could thrive. George Mason President Ángel Cabrera. (Evan Cantwell/Creative Services/GMU) That is why our public universities have overwhelmingly spoken up against the recent travel bans President Trump issued through executive order. While changes in immigration policy may very well be necessary, any moves that create additional barriers to the free flow of business and educational exchange threaten to erode our economic advantage and negatively impact our future. Consider this: all six Nobel Prize winners in the United States last year were immigrants, as were 40 percent of all American Nobel recipients in physics, chemistry, medicine and physiology since 2000. Microsoft is led by an Indian, as is Google, which was co-founded by a Russian. Tesla is the creation of a South African who’s now also revolutionizing space aircraft. The online shopping company eBay was started by a French national of Iranian descent, and the iPhone was designed by a Brit. Immigrants or their children started more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies, according to the Kauffman Foundation, and more than 50 percent of billion-plus startups had at least one foreign-born founder. A 2007 study by researchers from Duke University, the University of California at Berkeley and the Kauffman Foundation found that more than half of the foreign-born founders of American tech companies initially came to the United States to study. In some critical fields, such as engineering and computer science, foreign nationals already account for more than half of all doctoral degrees granted in America. The influx of international students into our universities does not take away resources from American students. On the contrary, foreign students contribute much-needed tuition dollars and have a positive impact on our local economies. The roughly 1 million foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities last year contributed more than $32 billion to the U.S. economy – double the amount of 10 years prior – and supported more than 400,000 U.S. jobs. International students strengthen our campuses by creating additional opportunities for American students to develop a more global mindset and build relationships that will prepare them to be more effective in an increasingly global marketplace. Despite these benefits, the advantage that American universities enjoy in attracting foreign talent should not be taken for granted. The perception of openness is just as important as the legal reality of openness. Whenever the United States is seen as less open and welcoming to people and ideas, this dynamic source of innovative talent suffers, as we saw in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In 2000, the United States attracted approximately 23 percent of all international students seeking to study outside their home country. After the attacks, changes in immigration policy and a belief that the United States was a less welcoming dropped that share to 17 percent. Only in recent years has our percentage of international students returned to 2000 levels. This loss was others’ gain. In the decade or so after 9/11, when the proportion of international students who came to the United States was shrinking, other English-speaking countries experienced rapid growth international students. The United Kingdom expanded its pool from 11 percent in 2000 to 18 percent in 2014; Australia expanded from 12.5 percent to 18.2 percent in that time, and Canada expanded its pool from less than 5 percent to nearly 10 percent. Drastic changes in U.S. immigration policy could once again encourage international students to look elsewhere. Current students from the six countries directly affected by the latest version of the travel ban may find other places to continue their education. This is especially true for those with single-entry visas who are effectively pre-empted from leaving the United States because they will not be allowed to re-enter. Similarly, other potential international students may decide to pursue their education outside the United States, as we appear to shut our doors to individuals of certain backgrounds. Few would argue against carefully vetting all who wish to enter the United States, and preventing anyone who represents a clear threat from reaching our shores.

Sadly, we found two such photos in the 1971 yearbook (if you must see them, you can find them online on pages 5 and 149). The yearbook does not reveal the identity of the happy and festive students proudly wearing the offensive makeup. And that’s probably a good thing. It makes it harder to direct our anger (or embarrassment, or frustration, or pain, or all of the above) towards the individuals in the photos and instead directs our attention towards the more difficult questions concerning the context that made that conduct acceptable then, the forms of discrimination we may be tolerating today, and the role universities should play in moving us forward towards a more inclusive and just society. I have no desire to condone the behavior of anyone in those photos. But it is obvious that behind every racist photo in a yearbook there were many other contributors: a photographer who thought the moment was worth capturing, editors who didn’t think twice about saving the image for posterity, witnesses who either found the slur amusing or didn’t have the courage to stop it, many other cases that likely went unrecorded, and, self-critically, campus leaders who either saw nothing wrong or preferred not to pay attention. As relieving as it may feel to blame campus racism on the few folks who were foolish enough to let themselves be photographed in the act, I am more concerned about the set of social norms that enabled that behavior and the possibility that some of those norms still linger. There is evidence that social norms at Mason were changing by the late 1980s. In a 1990 case that ended up in front of a United States District Court Judge, a fraternity was suspended after one of its members wore blackface at a fundraiser event it sponsored in the cafeteria. According to accounts in the New York Times and the Washington Post, a group of students of color were offended by the costume and complained to the dean of students. Campus tensions rose. The fraternity apologized: no harm intended, the fraternity president said, “it was just good fun”. Yet not all students got the joke and tensions kept mounting, leading the school to suspend the fraternity for two years. Unlike their 1970s counterparts, the students of 1990 seemed far less willing to accept bigotry and the administration felt either the pressure or the need to do something. What made this case a national story, though, was the follow up. The fraternity sued the university on the basis that their freedom of expression rights had been violated. What the students had done, their ACLU attorney argued, was reprehensible, but the university turned the “perpetrators of the offense into First Amendment martyrs” and missed the chance to use the incident as an educational opportunity. The fraternity won the lawsuit. The Mason case highlighted the constitutional limits universities face when confronting hateful speech, an issue that has not lost its currency and relevance today. When last Spring, a video of a group of white students singing along to a rap song with a generous dose of n-words was circulated online, we received numerous calls demanding severe disciplinary action against the students. As the 1990 case made clear though, students have the constitutional right to say racist things if they so choose. The question for public universities is not how to sanction expressions that may be offensive, insensitive or even hateful, which they cannot do. The question is how do we educate students to be more aware of the impact their words and actions have on others and to use their First Amendment rights responsibly. This is not the same as “coddling” our students’ minds, as universities have been accused of doing (a recent book by Lukianoff and Haidt presents the most compelling critique I’ve seen). It is about giving students better tools to contribute to a more inclusive society where diversity of thought and freedom of expression are tools of social progress and cohesion, rather than sources of pain and division. A group of faculty members at Mason, for example, is creating a course to do precisely that. The course is intended to increase students’ awareness by giving them an opportunity to hear from those marginalized communities that experience hurt and anger and will provide them with tools to handle situations when they may be on the receiving end of offensive speech. A university that prides itself of having one of the most diverse student bodies in the nation has the opportunity—even the responsibility—of leading the way in testing new educational approaches.

107,gmu5,3/27/19,George Mason University,Question about recent law school hires,Press,Political CT,"Over the last few days I have received a number of complaints about our law school’s decision to recruit U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who will co-teach a class in England this summer. While I don’t intend to change anybody’s views about this public figure, I do hope I can bring some clarity as to how and why these types of decisions are made. Indeed, this summer, two members of the U.S. Supreme Court are scheduled to teach overseas classes in partnership with our faculty. Justice Neil Gorsuch and Professor Jamil Jaffer will team up for the second time to teach a class in Padua, Italy about the historical roots and the modern application of the separation of powers in the national security context. And Justice Kavanaugh and Professor Jennifer Mascott will team teach a course on the origins and creation of the U.S. Constitution in Runnymede, England, the location of the sealing of the Magna Carta. These two courses are part of the law school’s on-going efforts to provide opportunities for students to learn from some of the most influential legal experts in the nation. The faculty (in this case the law school’s) approves these types of appointments based on their assessment of the qualifications of the individuals and the value they can bring to students. Justice Kavanaugh’s appointment was approved by the law school faculty in January. The class was announced to law school students soon thereafter and an information session was held in early February (for additional information, I’m pasting the announcement to students below). At this time, the class, which is elective, is oversubscribed. I respect the views of people who disagreed with Justice Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation due to questions raised about his sexual conduct in high school. But he was confirmed and is now a sitting Justice. The law school has determined that the involvement of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice contributes to making our law program uniquely valuable for our students. And I accept their judgment. This decision, controversial as it may be, in no way affects the university’s ongoing efforts to eradicate sexual violence from our campuses. We remain firmly committed to this goal, and I want to encourage students who feel strongly about sexual assault prevention at Mason to continue to raise their voices and help us move forward. We have made significant progress but have much more to do and we need the involvement of our entire community to continue to move forward. I’m encouraged that reports of sexual and interpersonal violence to both the Student Support and Advocacy Center and the Title IX office are up, which indicates survivors feel safer to speak up. The increased reports are putting pressure on our existing resources in both investigating cases and providing support to survivors, and we need to accelerate investments in these areas. In the next couple of days you should be receiving an update from University Life and Compliance, Diversity, and Ethics on what has been accomplished so far and the additional efforts underway. CREATION OF THE CONSTITUTION SUMMER COURSE in Runnymede, England co-taught by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh & Professor Jennifer L. Mascott July 22 to August 2, 2019 Brief information session will be held from 5:00 – 5:45 pm on Tuesday, February 5th, in Room 221. CALL FOR APPLICATIONS This summer George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School will introduce a new overseas course on the origins and creation of the Constitution. United States Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and Professor Jennifer Mascott will team teach the course just outside of London in Runnymede, England, the location of the sealing of the Magna Carta. In this two-credit course, titled Creation of the Constitution, students will study the historical origins of the Constitution and read Founding-era documents and debates shaping the content of the document. Students will be graded on their in-class participation and a 15-20 page paper that will be due a few weeks after the conclusion of the course. In addition to classroom instruction, the course will include several day trips to sites associated with the formation of principles influencing the content and structure of the Constitution. The course will begin with a brief examination of British constitutional heritage and Founding-era political philosophies such as republicanism and classical liberalism. Students will next study late eighteenth-century American documents and debates such as the Articles of Confederation, portions of Madison’s notes from the constitutional drafting debates, and early drafts of the Constitution. Finally, in addition to examining the development of structural constitutional principles such as federalism, separation of powers, and checks and balances, the course will cover debates over contested issues such as the proper scope of military and foreign affairs powers and the inclusion of a Bill of Rights. The class will also discuss how those constitutional principles apply to modern controversies and current events. During the spring 2019 semester, students enrolled in the course will have an opportunity to attend an oral argument at the Supreme Court along with a post-argument information session and discussion at the Court hosted by Justice Kavanaugh and Professor Mascott.",https://web.archive.org/web/20190625032644/https://president.gmu.edu/questions-about-recent-law-school-hires/,Angel Cabrera,Male,7/1/12,2460,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Trump & Racial Justice,1/1/12,12/31/22,Public,George Mason,VA,South,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",107,"Over the last few days I have received a number of complaints about our law school’s decision to recruit U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh who will co-teach a class in England this summer.

108,gmu6,7/23/20,George Mason University,President Washington Announces Task Force on Anti-Racism and Inclusive Excellence,Message,Social CT,"In the days that followed the murder of George Floyd, I sent you a message that promised action to address racial inequities that persist here at George Mason University. As I enter my fourth week as president, I want to share with you the actions we will begin to take, as a community of Patriots. George Mason University enters this national conversation with an admirable track record as a pace-setter of action for racial justice, and for truth-telling about our own past. We are proud to draw upon the expertise of: The Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation Campus Center, one of the first of its kind in the nation The Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution, one of the nation’s few schools dedicated to social justice and peace, and one of the very best The Enslaved People of George Mason research and memorial project, the ground-breaking undertaking by our own faculty and students to tell the full truth of our university’s namesake so that we may learn and grow from it. And of course we take pride in hosting Virginia’s largest and most diverse university student body, with a majority of our students representing communities of color, and our Black student population in particular recognized as among the nation’s top academic performers These are just some of the many examples of excellence and inclusion around racial justice that the Mason community has undertaken. They make us proud. But we have work to do if we are to ensure that every student, faculty, and staff member is welcomed and respected as a full equal in this community of learning. And the uncomfortable truth is not everyone at Mason feels equal, or is treated equally. So, today I am creating the President’s Task Force on Anti-Racism and Inclusive Excellence, and giving its members some big assignments. We need to know where systems, practices, and traditions of racial bias exist at George Mason University so that we may eradicate them. We must build intentional systems and standards of anti-racism that will keep racial injustices from regenerating. I want George Mason University to emerge from this exercise as a local, regional, and national beacon for the advancement of anti-racism, reconciliation, and healing. This task force will have a broad focus, with particular areas of emphasis including short-term and long-term improvements to how we approach: Curriculum and Pedagogy Campus and Community Engagement University Policies and Practices Research Training and Development The task force will comprise many of Mason’s luminaries in racial justice, who will be joined by national experts in this topic. Members will be announced over the course of the coming weeks, and they will represent the full diversity of George Mason University, including racial, ethnic, gender, sexual identity, and religious identity. The recommendations that we act upon will be incorporated into the university’s planning and budgeting process to ensure they have the priority and resources to take root and flourish. I am not interested in reports that sit on a shelf, only to collect dust. Many reforms at Mason will require thoughtful consideration over time by the task force and university leadership. Others are obvious, overdue, and simply require executive leadership. So, in keeping with my pledge to deliver actions and not just words, I am announcing immediate steps that we are taking to advance systemic and cultural anti-racism at George Mason University. The many steps that we have identified are available in their entirety on my website, President.gmu.edu. The categories of immediate steps we are taking include: Policing In addition to state-mandated anti-racism training for all police personnel, we will convert the existing Community Police Council into a Police Advisory Board that actively monitors the nature of police activity and reports its findings to me. University Policies A number of university policies and practices that carry racist vestiges in their practices will be examined and/or curtailed, including: Faculty salary equity – We will complete and act upon a faculty salary equity review and work with the schools and colleges toward correcting any issues over a three-year period. Inclusive excellence planning – At the college and school level, we will establish Inclusive Excellence Plans that articulate the vision and definition of anti-racism and inclusiveness for that unit. The task force will develop a metric-driven template for units to use. Implicit bias training – Mason will establish an Inclusive Excellence Certificate Program that certifies that the schools and colleges have completed Implicit Bias Training and have established Inclusive Excellence Plans. Implicit bias recognition in faculty promotion and tenure – We will develop specific recommendations for the renewal, promotion, and tenure processes that address implicit bias, discrimination, and other equity issues (e.g., invisible and uncredited labor) to support faculty of color and women in their professional work. Equity Advisors in every academic department – Equity Advisors are senior faculty members, appointed as Faculty Assistant to the Dean in their respective schools. Equity Advisors participate in faculty recruiting by approving search committee shortlists and strategies and raising awareness of best practices. Additionally, they organize faculty development programs, with both formal and informal mentoring, and address individual issues raised by women and faculty from underrepresented groups. Recognizing and rewarding adversity barriers in promotion and tenure – We will develop specific mechanisms in the promotion and tenure process that recognize the invisible and uncredited emotional labor that people of color expend to learn, teach, discover, and work on campus. Racial Trauma and Healing We will increase the support provided to students, faculty, and staff through Mason’s Counseling and Psychological Services for students, and Human Resources for faculty and staff. Curriculum/Pedagogy We will finalize development and implementation of required diversity, inclusion, and well-being coursework. We will require an anti-racism statement on all syllabi. Buildings and Grounds We will convene the University Naming Committee to evaluate names of university buildings and memorials to ensure they align with the university’s stated mission to serve as an “academic community committed to creating a more just, free, and prosperous world.” Community Engagement We will grow our K-12 and community college partnerships by 50 percent, and become a true partner in the development of our region. We will establish a lecture series on anti-racism and inclusive excellence to establish a collective consciousness among the campus community. Resource Commitments We will identify associated budget to achieve above immediate actions, beginning with an initial $5 million commitment over three years to strengthen initiatives already underway and to fund critical priorities that need immediate attention. We will identify an Executive Director for the Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation Campus Center. Leadership in an anti-racism environment demands that we recognize how our history has shaped our view of the world and how our own actions can reshape it. My vision is nothing short of establishing George Mason University as a national exemplar of anti-racism and inclusive excellence in action. Given the considerable head start we have on most of our sister institutions in the United States, this is a vision we can realize.

109,uva1,11/22/14,University of Virginia,Statement from U-Va. President Teresa Sullivan on sexual assault allegations,Message,Social CT,"Over the past week many of you have reached out to me directly to offer your opinions, reactions, and suggestions related to combatting sexual violence on Grounds. I want you to know that I have heard you, and that your words have enkindled this message. At UVa we speak in idealistic terms: honor and tradition inform our thinking, and balance our daily actions. And it is easy here, where success is demanded as much as it is sought, to let our idealism outweigh our reality. Jefferson, as he always does, provides a compelling backdrop: It is more honorable to repair a wrong than to persist in it. The wrongs described in Rolling Stone are appalling and have caused all of us to reexamine our responsibility to this community. Rape is an abhorrent crime that has no place in the world, let alone on the campuses and grounds of our nation’s colleges and universities. We know, and have felt very powerfully this week, that we are better than we have been described, and that we have a responsibility to live our tradition of honor every day, and as importantly every night. As you are aware, I have asked the Charlottesville Police Department to investigate the 2012 assault that is described in Rolling Stone. There are individuals in our community who know what happened that night, and I am calling on them to come forward to the police to report the facts. Only you can shed light on the truth, and it is your responsibility to do so. Alongside this investigation, we as a community must also do a systematic evaluation of our culture to ensure that one of our founding principles — the pursuit of truth — remains a pillar on which we can stand. There is no greater threat to honor than secrecy and indifference. I write you today in solidarity. I write you in great sorrow, great rage, but most importantly, with great determination. Meaningful change is necessary, and we can lead that change for all universities. We can demand that incidents like those described in Rolling Stone never happen and that if they do, the responsible are held accountable to the law. This will require institutional change, cultural change, and legislative change, and it will not be easy. We are making those changes. This morning the Inter-Fraternity Council announced that all University fraternities have voluntarily suspended social activities this weekend. This is an important first step, but our challenges will extend beyond this weekend. Beginning immediately, I am suspending all fraternal organizations and associated social activities until January 9th, ahead of the beginning of our spring semester. In the intervening period we will assemble groups of students, faculty, alumni, and other concerned parties to discuss our next steps in preventing sexual assault and sexual violence on Grounds. On Tuesday, the Board of Visitors will meet to discuss the University’s policies and procedures regarding sexual assault as well as the specific, recent allegations. In the words of one student who wrote to me this week, ""Policy is needed, but people make change."" We need the collective strength of the members of our community to ensure that we have the best policies. So as you prepare for what I hope is a restful Thanksgiving holiday, I hope that you will take time to review and respond to the recently posted Student Sexual Misconduct Policy, which is currently open for public comment. You may find that policy at this link. Providing candid feedback to this policy is a practical step that you can take to help and I hope that you will. To our fourth-year students: as you prepare to celebrate your last home football game today, I hope that you will embrace your role as leaders and demonstrate a renewed sense of responsibility to our community, and a renewed commitment to make that community better. It starts today. Finally, I want to express my grief at hearing the news of the death of second-year student Peter D’Agostino, whose passing adds overwhelming emotion to what has been a difficult semester for all of us. We are united in our compassion, resolve, and determination: Compassion for survivors of assault; resolve to make our community better; determination to begin to solve this problem here and now. I hope that you will join me.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/statement-from-u-va-president-teresa-sullivan-on-sexual-assault-allegations/2014/11/22/342d40ec-728c-11e4-8808-afaa1e3a33ef_story.html,Teresa Sullivan,Female,8/1/10,1574,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Trump & Racial Justice,1/1/12,12/31/22,Public,Charlottesville,VA,South,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",109,"Over the past week many of you have reached out to me directly to offer your opinions, reactions, and suggestions related to combatting sexual violence on Grounds.

In the words of one student who wrote to me this week, ""Policy is needed, but people make change."" We need the collective strength of the members of our community to ensure that we have the best policies. So as you prepare for what I hope is a restful Thanksgiving holiday, I hope that you will take time to review and respond to the recently posted Student Sexual Misconduct Policy, which is currently open for public comment. You may find that policy at this link. Providing candid feedback to this policy is a practical step that you can take to help and I hope that you will. To our fourth-year students: as you prepare to celebrate your last home football game today, I hope that you will embrace your role as leaders and demonstrate a renewed sense of responsibility to our community, and a renewed commitment to make that community better. It starts today. Finally, I want to express my grief at hearing the news of the death of second-year student Peter D’Agostino, whose passing adds overwhelming emotion to what has been a difficult semester for all of us. We are united in our compassion, resolve, and determination: Compassion for survivors of assault; resolve to make our community better; determination to begin to solve this problem here and now. I hope that you will join me.",724,0.031722054,0.179758308,0.028700906,0.02265861,0.019637462,0.055891239,0.025679758,0.083081571,0.034743202,0.00755287,0.010574018,0.098187311,0.064954683,0.074018127,0.019637462,0.055891239,0.043806647,0.028700906,0.031722054,0.083081571,0.370090634,0.17673716,0.232628399,0.220543807,11/22/14,"Trump &

110,uva2,6/5/21,University of Virginia,American Democracy is in Danger. Here’s How Universities Can Help Protect It.,Press,Political CT,"Five months after the insurrection of Jan. 6, the country is still waiting for answers. How could this have happened – and why? Who should be held to account for an attack on the heart of our government? Were mistakes made in preparation or response? These are important questions that demand a reply. But our inability to answer – or even debate – them reflects the deepening chasm in our democracy and raises even more urgent issues. What must we do to protect and strengthen the principles that define and guide our American experiment? How can we build a democratic culture that bolsters our institutions and ensures they work effectively – for everyone? How can we repair damage that’s already been done? This, of course, is the responsibility of every citizen. But it’s also a special responsibility of institutions of higher education. Colleges and universities are uniquely positioned to nurture democracy, and to strengthen the norms and cultural beliefs that are necessary for it to function. As leaders within higher education, we also can’t deny that some people think universities are part of the problem instead of a part of the solution. We have our own work to do in rebuilding trust and credibility with all Americans, especially the skeptics who portray us only as instruments of liberal indoctrination or protectors of ingrained systems of power. The good news is the most valuable work universities can undertake to support democracy is purposeful and nonpartisan. And there is plenty we can and should contribute. At its heart, a university creates knowledge and pursues truth through scholarship and research. It encourages and facilitates civil debate. It brings together people with different experiences and points of view and – through university life and thoughtful engagement in the surrounding community – positions them to interact, compromise and build the relationships necessary to foster respect. We won’t always agree, but our democracy compels us to learn how to disagree without destroying each other. As it turns out, our institution has been at this for some time. Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819 with a mission of educating citizen leaders who could contribute to the functioning of what was then a very young American democracy. That founding purpose animates us today, some 200 years later – now including, of course, women and people of color who were excluded for more than a century. Our own experience shows how important it is to sustain founding principles that are indisputably good – education to prepare citizens to serve as “guardians of their own rights,” for example – while ensuring they’re applied for everyone’s benefit. Universities Can Lead the Debate The same is true of a healthy democracy. This is a time when we need to discover – or rediscover – ways to protect and strengthen our system of government so that it works for everyone. Higher education must lead. Together, we need to engage even more people in discussion and debate about our country’s future, on campus and beyond. Universities should assertively lead the way forward in research and analysis of democracy itself, identifying its successes and shortcomings, and addressing challenges head-on. Hand-in-glove with discussion and debate, higher education must also be a place for action. There’s a long history of impact-oriented work at colleges and universities. Many of the strategies and tactics used to dismantle legal discrimination were crafted and refined in the halls of Howard University’s School of Law, where leading civil rights lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston were trained or taught. Stanford University helped breathe life into Silicon Valley and the technological advances that have changed the world. Across higher education are voluminous examples of invention, service and outreach that have improved the lives of all Americans. But we also believe there’s far more to be done. The challenges facing our democracy demand that we place a big bet on the work that higher education can – and must – do to help solve them. That requires that we continue the pursuit of new knowledge and translate what we learn so it can be used by policymakers, practitioners, private sector leaders and the public.

The institute will be nonpartisan, public-facing and impact-oriented, providing opportunities for our seven existing, democracy-focused schools and centers to collaborate – doing work they couldn’t do alone – and launching its own signature initiatives focused on shoring up America’s wobbling democracy. In another six months, the attack on the Capitol will command even less of the country’s interest. New crises will emerge, as they always do, and consume our attention.

112,uva4,3/9/17,University of Virginia,"At Higher Ed Conference, UVA President Offers Vigorous Support of Free Speech",Remarks,Political CT,"This year in Charlottesville, we’re celebrating a momentous occasion – momentous not only in the history of the University of Virginia, but in the history of American higher education. In October, we’ll mark the 200th anniversary of the laying of UVA’s cornerstone, launching a bicentennial celebration that will culminate in 2019, which is the 200th anniversary of the University’s founding charter. When Thomas Jefferson conceived UVA two centuries ago, he based it on a radical proposition. He said, “This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.” Jefferson wrote those words in 1820, when most universities were still church-affiliated and constrained by religious doctrine, offering only a limited course of study – law, medicine, divinity, and so on. To create a university based on total freedom of thought and expression was a bold idea. Today, in our public universities, free expression is protected by the First Amendment. In our private universities, it’s upheld by the commitment to academic freedom. Free speech is our lingua franca in academia, and any restriction on it seems incompatible with the fundamental values of higher education. And yet those principles that Jefferson articulated 200 years ago, and that we continue to espouse in our colleges and universities today – following truth, tolerating error, fighting error with reason – seem to be increasingly questioned, and even threatened, on college campuses. There’s some irony in the fact that I began these remarks by quoting Thomas Jefferson, because my quoting of Jefferson became the crux of a free-speech debate at my own university last fall. In early November, following the presidential election, I sent a message to UVA students, faculty and staff calling for unity and civility on our Grounds. I was planning to send this message regardless of who won the election, because it was clear that the divisiveness would continue no matter who became president. In the message, I urged students not to withdraw from the political process because of any dismay they might be feeling. I included a Jefferson quote that spoke to their future roles as servants and leaders in our country’s government. In response, about 500 UVA faculty and students sent me a letter asking me to stop quoting Thomas Jefferson in my messages to the University community. They criticized me for using Jefferson as a “moral compass,” noting his involvement in slavery during his lifetime. In my response to their letter, I made the point that quoting Jefferson – or any historical figure – does not imply an endorsement of all the social structures and beliefs of his time, such as slavery and the exclusion of women and people of color from university life. For those faculty and students, I made it clear that I disagreed with their argument. At the same time, however, I said that I “fully endorsed” their right to speak out on issues they care about, including UVA’s complicated Jeffersonian legacy. Of course the Jefferson-quote controversy at UVA is just one of many examples of this issue. Lately, campus free-speech controversies have often revolved around the disinviting of speakers whose views offend one group or another. In February 2015, the well-known feminist activist Angela Davis was disinvited from speaking at Texas Tech after College Republicans launched a petition to block her appearance. Later the same year, Suzanne Venker, a well-known critic of feminism, was disinvited from speaking at Williams College after student protests. Ironically, Venker was to appear as part of a speaker series titled “Uncomfortable Learning,” created to expose students to views that contrast with their own. In April 2015, the singer-songwriter Common was disinvited from speaking at Kean University’s graduation ceremony after an outcry from law enforcement officials, who complained that the lyrics of one of his songs glorified violence against police. Last month, officials at Berkeley cancelled a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos after violent protesters (who were not Berkeley students) took over an otherwise peaceful protest. Because of the cancellation, Berkeley officials were accused of suppressing free speech, and the president of the United States, in a Tweet, raised the threat of cutting the school’s federal funding as punishment. In the most recent example, this month hundreds of students and some non-students at Middlebury College shouted down Charles Murray, a writer who is accused of espousing racist ideas, stopping him from giving a public lecture. College officials moved Murray and the faculty moderator to another location to livestream the discussion; after the event, protesters surrounded them as they were leaving, things got physical, and the protesters injured the faculty moderator, Allison Stanger. As far as I know, this was the first such incident that involved a physical attack. What’s also troubling is that protestors wanted to shut down Murray without even knowing what he would say – potentially robbing themselves of the opportunity to refute his views. Notice that this list of disinvited and shouted-down speakers includes those who lean left as well as those who lean right. They range from extremely liberal to extremely illiberal. The attack on free speech is not coming exclusively from the right or the left. Free speech is being attacked from both sides, from all sides. We’ve even seen efforts by state legislatures to regulate free speech on campus, another alarming development. In our leadership roles in higher education, our responsibility is to stand in the middle ground between extremes, defending free speech for everyone, fending off against attacks from all sides, regardless of political beliefs or personal opinions. The current free-speech controversy is riddled with ironies. Here’s one: In the 1960s, during the Free Speech Movement that started at Berkeley and spread to other campuses, students were the loudest proponents of free speech. Today, some students are the loudest opponents of free speech – sometimes without even realizing that they are. A 2016 Gallup survey on “Free Expression on Campus” showed that college students were overwhelmingly in favor of free expression on campus in general, but they were also in favor of restrictions on “intentionally offensive” speech. In this environment, many universities have adopted codes or policies prohibiting speech that may offend any group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. In a report published this year, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, known as FIRE, surveyed about 450 schools and found that 40 percent of them had severely restrictive speech codes that clearly prohibit constitutionally protected speech. We need to remember, and we need to remind our students, that the First Amendment protects all speech – unless it includes threats of physical violence – and this includes speech that some may consider intolerant and offensive. In the 1960s, Berkeley Chancellor Clark Kerr lifted a ban that had kept Communist speakers off the Berkeley campus. He explained the decision by saying: “The University is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas. Thus it permits the freest expression of views before students, trusting to their good sense in passing judgment on these views. Only in this way can it best serve American democracy.” If we protect college students today from opposing views and diverse perspectives through “speech codes” or other restrictions on free expression, we do them a great disservice, because we’re leaving them unprepared for the intellectual and social fray that they will enter the moment they step off our campuses. The college campus is a natural proving ground for putting free speech principles into practice, because in higher education we believe in two fundamental ideas that sometimes come into conflict with each other. Because of our commitment to academic freedom, open discourse and the clash of ideas, we vigorously support free speech. At the same time, in our increasingly diverse campus communities, we urge our students and others to show respect for the diverse backgrounds and views represented on our campuses. Last October, PEN America released a report titled “And Campus for All: Diversity, Inclusion, and Free Speech at U.S. Universities.” The report concludes that an environment where “too many offenses are considered impermissible or even punishable becomes sterile, constraining and inimical to creativity.” The danger in shutting out viewpoints that differ from our own is that we create a personal echo chamber in which our deeply held beliefs are continually reinforced by those who share those beliefs. If we follow only the news outlets and social media feeds that align with our opinions, we have no access to the diversity of ideas that we espouse in higher education. Almost 200 years ago, John Stuart Mill addressed this issue in his essay, “On Liberty.” The following is an extended excerpt, but it’s worth quoting in its entirety: He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion. … Nor is it enough that he should hear the opinions of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them. … He must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form.” To put John Stuart Mill in terms of this month’s controversy, the people who shouted down Charles Murray at Middlebury were only selling themselves short, because they lost the chance to hear his views directly from him and therefore lost the chance to understand them more fully, and to refute them more fully. Ninety years ago, in his concurring opinion in Whitney v. California, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the process of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” The solution is to “tolerate any error” but always to “combat [the errors] with reason,” to use Jefferson’s language. We can’t go back to the ancient anti-religious-freedom concept that “error has no rights”; that idea ended with people getting burned at the stake. In the 21st century, everyone has the right to be wrong. The principles of free speech and campus inclusiveness should not be in conflict with each other; rather, they should reinforce each other. More voices, more perspectives from different backgrounds, all free to speak, free to disagree, free to discuss and debate. We need to promote both free speech and diversity and inclusiveness on our campuses; we cannot let that become a mutually exclusive relationship. With the right to free speech firmly established, we need to create inclusive environments on our campuses in which everyone feels free to exercise that right. So how can we do both? Once again, the answer is more speech. First, when members of university communities learn about verbal insults that include racist, sexist, homophobic, ethnic or other forms of bias, we need to join together to denounce them and to support those who have been targeted. Second, we need to continue our efforts to diversify our faculty, staff and student populations. We know that when people of different races, genders and backgrounds come together, the exchange enriches the learning experience for every member of our college and university communities. Third, we need to continue to examine our curricula as well as extra-curricular activities, such as study-abroad programs, to ensure that all of our students have opportunities to be exposed to a wide range of cultures, beliefs and perspectives, both in the classroom and beyond the classroom. Those exposures instill cultural awareness and tolerance in our students. Perhaps one of the best solutions is to do exactly what we’re doing here this week: talking about it; having a sustained, open dialogue about the issues that we face as educators. Candid discussion is the first step toward solutions. The tone of our current national discourse shows us at least one thing: our colleges and universities need to produce graduates who are critical, deliberative thinkers, capable of listening to all sides of an argument before drawing conclusions, but also unafraid to speak out and express their own views. As leaders in higher education, when free expression seems to be under attack from all sides of the political spectrum, we can set the right example by standing in the middle ground to defend it on all sides. At the end of the popular musical “Hamilton,” Alexander Hamilton is remarking on the contentious election of 1800. He endorses Thomas Jefferson for president over Aaron Burr with these words: I have never agreed with Jefferson once … We have fought on 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done… Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none. Hamilton endorses Thomas Jefferson because he knows what Jefferson believes, and he knows where Jefferson stands on the issues. And that’s what observers around the nation should know about education leaders and our position on free speech. We stand in the middle ground, defending free speech on all sides … following truth, wherever it leads … tolerating any error, but combating error with reason … and continuing to believe in the illimitable freedom of the human mind.",https://news.virginia.edu/content/higher-ed-conference-uva-president-offers-vigorous-support-free-speech,Teresa Sullivan,Female,8/1/10,2412,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Republican,Republican,Trump & Racial Justice,1/1/12,12/31/22,Public,Charlottesville,VA,South,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",112,"This year in Charlottesville, we’re celebrating a momentous occasion – momentous not only in the history of the University of Virginia, but in the history of American higher education.

For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.” Jefferson wrote those words in 1820, when most universities were still church-affiliated and constrained by religious doctrine, offering only a limited course of study – law, medicine, divinity, and so on. To create a university based on total freedom of thought and expression was a bold idea. Today, in our public universities, free expression is protected by the First Amendment. In our private universities, it’s upheld by the commitment to academic freedom. Free speech is our lingua franca in academia, and any restriction on it seems incompatible with the fundamental values of higher education. And yet those principles that Jefferson articulated 200 years ago, and that we continue to espouse in our colleges and universities today – following truth, tolerating error, fighting error with reason – seem to be increasingly questioned, and even threatened, on college campuses. There’s some irony in the fact that I began these remarks by quoting Thomas Jefferson, because my quoting of Jefferson became the crux of a free-speech debate at my own university last fall. In early November, following the presidential election, I sent a message to UVA students, faculty and staff calling for unity and civility on our Grounds. I was planning to send this message regardless of who won the election, because it was clear that the divisiveness would continue no matter who became president. In the message, I urged students not to withdraw from the political process because of any dismay they might be feeling. I included a Jefferson quote that spoke to their future roles as servants and leaders in our country’s government. In response, about 500 UVA faculty and students sent me a letter asking me to stop quoting Thomas Jefferson in my messages to the University community. They criticized me for using Jefferson as a “moral compass,” noting his involvement in slavery during his lifetime. In my response to their letter, I made the point that quoting Jefferson – or any historical figure – does not imply an endorsement of all the social structures and beliefs of his time, such as slavery and the exclusion of women and people of color from university life. For those faculty and students, I made it clear that I disagreed with their argument. At the same time, however, I said that I “fully endorsed” their right to speak out on issues they care about, including UVA’s complicated Jeffersonian legacy. Of course the Jefferson-quote controversy at UVA is just one of many examples of this issue. Lately, campus free-speech controversies have often revolved around the disinviting of speakers whose views offend one group or another. In February 2015, the well-known feminist activist Angela Davis was disinvited from speaking at Texas Tech after College Republicans launched a petition to block her appearance. Later the same year, Suzanne Venker, a well-known critic of feminism, was disinvited from speaking at Williams College after student protests. Ironically, Venker was to appear as part of a speaker series titled “Uncomfortable Learning,” created to expose students to views that contrast with their own. In April 2015, the singer-songwriter Common was disinvited from speaking at Kean University’s graduation ceremony after an outcry from law enforcement officials, who complained that the lyrics of one of his songs glorified violence against police. Last month, officials at Berkeley cancelled a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos after violent protesters (who were not Berkeley students) took over an otherwise peaceful protest. Because of the cancellation, Berkeley officials were accused of suppressing free speech, and the president of the United States, in a Tweet, raised the threat of cutting the school’s federal funding as punishment. In the most recent example, this month hundreds of students and some non-students at Middlebury College shouted down Charles Murray, a writer who is accused of espousing racist ideas, stopping him from giving a public lecture. College officials moved Murray and the faculty moderator to another location to livestream the discussion; after the event, protesters surrounded them as they were leaving, things got physical, and the protesters injured the faculty moderator, Allison Stanger. As far as I know, this was the first such incident that involved a physical attack. What’s also troubling is that protestors wanted to shut down Murray without even knowing what he would say – potentially robbing themselves of the opportunity to refute his views. Notice that this list of disinvited and shouted-down speakers includes those who lean left as well as those who lean right. They range from extremely liberal to extremely illiberal. The attack on free speech is not coming exclusively from the right or the left. Free speech is being attacked from both sides, from all sides. We’ve even seen efforts by state legislatures to regulate free speech on campus, another alarming development. In our leadership roles in higher education, our responsibility is to stand in the middle ground between extremes, defending free speech for everyone, fending off against attacks from all sides, regardless of political beliefs or personal opinions. The current free-speech controversy is riddled with ironies. Here’s one: In the 1960s, during the Free Speech Movement that started at Berkeley and spread to other campuses, students were the loudest proponents of free speech. Today, some students are the loudest opponents of free speech – sometimes without even realizing that they are. A 2016 Gallup survey on “Free Expression on Campus” showed that college students were overwhelmingly in favor of free expression on campus in general, but they were also in favor of restrictions on “intentionally offensive” speech. In this environment, many universities have adopted codes or policies prohibiting speech that may offend any group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. In a report published this year, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, known as FIRE, surveyed about 450 schools and found that 40 percent of them had severely restrictive speech codes that clearly prohibit constitutionally protected speech. We need to remember, and we need to remind our students, that the First Amendment protects all speech – unless it includes threats of physical violence – and this includes speech that some may consider intolerant and offensive. In the 1960s, Berkeley Chancellor Clark Kerr lifted a ban that had kept Communist speakers off the Berkeley campus. He explained the decision by saying: “The University is not engaged in making ideas safe for students. It is engaged in making students safe for ideas. Thus it permits the freest expression of views before students, trusting to their good sense in passing judgment on these views. Only in this way can it best serve American democracy.” If we protect college students today from opposing views and diverse perspectives through “speech codes” or other restrictions on free expression, we do them a great disservice, because we’re leaving them unprepared for the intellectual and social fray that they will enter the moment they step off our campuses. The college campus is a natural proving ground for putting free speech principles into practice, because in higher education we believe in two fundamental ideas that sometimes come into conflict with each other. Because of our commitment to academic freedom, open discourse and the clash of ideas, we vigorously support free speech. At the same time, in our increasingly diverse campus communities, we urge our students and others to show respect for the diverse backgrounds and views represented on our campuses. Last October, PEN America released a report titled “And Campus for All: Diversity, Inclusion, and Free Speech at U.S. Universities.” The report concludes that an environment where “too many offenses are considered impermissible or even punishable becomes sterile, constraining and inimical to creativity.” The danger in shutting out viewpoints that differ from our own is that we create a personal echo chamber in which our deeply held beliefs are continually reinforced by those who share those beliefs. If we follow only the news outlets and social media feeds that align with our opinions, we have no access to the diversity of ideas that we espouse in higher education. Almost 200 years ago, John Stuart Mill addressed this issue in his essay, “On Liberty.” The following is an extended excerpt, but it’s worth quoting in its entirety: He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been able to refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on the opposite side, if he does not so much as know what they are, he has no ground for preferring either opinion. … Nor is it enough that he should hear the opinions of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. He must be able to hear them from persons who actually believe them. … He must know them in their most plausible and persuasive form.” To put John Stuart Mill in terms of this month’s controversy, the people who shouted down Charles Murray at Middlebury were only selling themselves short, because they lost the chance to hear his views directly from him and therefore lost the chance to understand them more fully, and to refute them more fully. Ninety years ago, in his concurring opinion in Whitney v. California, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, “If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the process of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” The solution is to “tolerate any error” but always to “combat [the errors] with reason,” to use Jefferson’s language. We can’t go back to the ancient anti-religious-freedom concept that “error has no rights”; that idea ended with people getting burned at the stake. In the 21st century, everyone has the right to be wrong. The principles of free speech and campus inclusiveness should not be in conflict with each other; rather, they should reinforce each other. More voices, more perspectives from different backgrounds, all free to speak, free to disagree, free to discuss and debate. We need to promote both free speech and diversity and inclusiveness on our campuses; we cannot let that become a mutually exclusive relationship. With the right to free speech firmly established, we need to create inclusive environments on our campuses in which everyone feels free to exercise that right. So how can we do both? Once again, the answer is more speech. First, when members of university communities learn about verbal insults that include racist, sexist, homophobic, ethnic or other forms of bias, we need to join together to denounce them and to support those who have been targeted. Second, we need to continue our efforts to diversify our faculty, staff and student populations. We know that when people of different races, genders and backgrounds come together, the exchange enriches the learning experience for every member of our college and university communities. Third, we need to continue to examine our curricula as well as extra-curricular activities, such as study-abroad programs, to ensure that all of our students have opportunities to be exposed to a wide range of cultures, beliefs and perspectives, both in the classroom and beyond the classroom. Those exposures instill cultural awareness and tolerance in our students. Perhaps one of the best solutions is to do exactly what we’re doing here this week: talking about it; having a sustained, open dialogue about the issues that we face as educators. Candid discussion is the first step toward solutions. The tone of our current national discourse shows us at least one thing: our colleges and universities need to produce graduates who are critical, deliberative thinkers, capable of listening to all sides of an argument before drawing conclusions, but also unafraid to speak out and express their own views. As leaders in higher education, when free expression seems to be under attack from all sides of the political spectrum, we can set the right example by standing in the middle ground to defend it on all sides. At the end of the popular musical “Hamilton,” Alexander Hamilton is remarking on the contentious election of 1800. He endorses Thomas Jefferson for president over Aaron Burr with these words: I have never agreed with Jefferson once … We have fought on 75 different fronts But when all is said and all is done… Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none. Hamilton endorses Thomas Jefferson because he knows what Jefferson believes, and he knows where Jefferson stands on the issues. And that’s what observers around the nation should know about education leaders and our position on free speech. We stand in the middle ground, defending free speech on all sides … following truth, wherever it leads … tolerating any error, but combating error with reason … and continuing to believe in the illimitable freedom of the human mind.",2271,0.008508509,0.025525526,0.018518519,0.014514515,0.031531532,0.056556557,0.006506507,0.021521522,0.005505506,0.010510511,0.02952953,0.032532533,0.030530531,0.525025025,0.045545546,0.093593594,0.017517518,0.011511512,0.003503504,0.011511512,0.664164164,0.060560561,0.103103103,0.172172172,3/9/17,"Trump &

113,uva5,3/25/22,University of Virginia,Conversations around Pence show free expression is ‘alive and well’ on Grounds,Press,Political CT,"We have read with interest the differing perspectives published in The Cavalier Daily and elsewhere regarding the forthcoming visit of former vice president Mike Pence to Grounds. We have also heard the concerns from people inside and outside of our community who believe that the discussion happening about whether Mr. Pence should speak at the University is proof of a hostility toward free expression and ideological diversity on Grounds. We disagree. We should all be proud that this University is a place where students have the courage and the platform to raise perspectives about events like these — regardless of their popularity among their peers or with prominent figures from outside of this community. The exchange of ideas about Mr. Pence’s presence on Grounds is not a sign that free expression is dead on Grounds — it’s a sign that it is alive and well. Indeed, as paradoxical as it might seem, the protection of free speech has to allow room for those who want to argue against the idea or in favor of constraints on speech — otherwise, we would be protecting speech by way of censorship. We recognize the concern that The Cavalier Daily’s Editorial Board raises about the real impact speech can have on people’s lives. Too often, our arguments about freedom of expression overlook the truth that some forms of speech and some ideas can lead to harmful results if they are left unchecked and unchallenged. However, that is not an argument to annul or prohibit protected speech. As stated in the free speech statement recently endorsed by the Board of Visitors — “all views, beliefs, and perspectives deserve to be articulated and heard, free from interference. This commitment underpins every part of the University’s mission.” As the statement explains, this is not because “every idea is equally good.” Instead, it “reflects the view that every idea must be heard so that it may be subjected to the rigorous scrutiny necessary to advance knowledge.” This includes, it should be noted, ensuring that the University protect the right to articulate, hear and debate ideas that some might label “inherently divisive,” whatever that might mean. One of our tasks as a university is to give our students the tools to evaluate these ideas, alongside many others, and decide for themselves, as active members of our democracy, which ideas they support and which they oppose. As Clark Kerr, the renowned former president of the University of California, once wrote, our task is not to make ideas safe for students, but to make students safe for ideas. Where we can be different as a university — and where we should strive to be different — is in the approach we take to these discussions. While social media trolls and pundits often attack the motives and the character of those with whom they disagree, we can and should listen and learn from those differences and use them to make our own ideas and arguments better. As we explain more fully in an essay, we can and should strive to be both empathetic speakers and generous listeners. Mr. Pence’s visit — like that of every other prominent speaker or professor who visits Grounds — is an opportunity to listen and grow in our understanding of a particular perspective on the future of our nation and our world. It is also an opportunity to make a case against that vision.

114,uva6,7/11/12,University of Virginia,Special message from President Teresa A. Sullivan,Message,Campus CT,"Two weeks ago I was reinstated as the eighth President of the University. I write today to tell you what I have been doing and my plans for going forward. Since the day I was reinstated, I have been taking soundings from many in the University community. The Governor has appointed new members of the Board of Visitors, and I have taken the opportunity to speak with them, with the Rector, and with incumbent Board members. I have also spoken with faculty leaders, staff and administrators, and with many alumni, parents, and community members. Although many of our students are not here for the summer, a number of them have also contacted me. It is fair to say that I am far behind in answering my mail. The Marine Corps has a saying about ""another opportunity disguised as a disaster."" I believe it is important for us to regard the events of the past month as pointing the way to opportunities. Former Rector and Board member Heywood Fralin observed that the University community is more united than at any time he can remember. More than I could have ever imagined, our difficulties here have galvanized our stakeholders, both internal and external, in extraordinary ways. We are better positioned than ever before to address the difficult issues facing higher education. We are not different from the rest of higher education in having these issues; we are different in that we have displayed the unity to begin addressing them. I do not believe that what happened divided us into winners and losers; instead, I believe that the University of Virginia will be the winner. But it will also be necessary for us to pursue reconciliation with those with whom we differed, to repair relationships that have frayed, and always to let civility replace hostility. To the extent that I am able, I will lead this effort by example. We will have many conversations in the coming months about the University's direction and aims. Yet at this moment, I want to affirm: DESPITE OUR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES, WE PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE, often at a fraction of the expenditures of our peers. Public universities face difficult financial challenges, and we are no different: Tuition increases have not replaced the loss of state subsidies, and yet the tuition increases have placed serious burdens on many families. We receive less money today from the state's General Fund and tuition to educate an in-state undergraduate student, in constant dollars, than we did in 1989. Still, U.Va. has maintained triple-A bond ratings from all three major credit agencies for nine consecutive years, a reflection of our fiscal stability and sound management. The national prominence of Darden and Law indicates the success we can achieve when we are allowed to compete in the market without subsidy; whether this successful experiment could be extended to other fields is a matter of politics as much as economics. OUR FACULTY AND STAFF are the future of the University. Our faculty brings passion, expertise, and considerable pedagogical innovation to their students, yet they and their staff colleagues have experienced salary stagnation for years. While of course it is important to continue to look for efficiencies, it is folly to think that cost-cutting alone will be our salvation. We face the replacement of a generation of faculty who have shaped the institution and are now nearing retirement. What we do in the next decade will determine U.Va.'s continued prominence in its third century. THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE is and will remain the top priority of our health care providers. The recent Supreme Court decision on health care will affect our Health System, no doubt in ways we cannot yet predict. Whatever the future of health care in this country, I will not rest until ours is recognized as the safest hospital in the nation. We have come together with a sense of purpose and a conviction of how special this University is. The weeks ahead will give us the opportunity to discuss and debate the possible solutions to these and other issues. I plan to hold a town hall meeting closer to the opening of the fall semester to lay out some of the issues as I see them.

115,csu1,1/13/21,California State University,Reflections on Democracy and Recent Events,Message,Political CT,"I’ve spent the past several days reflecting on the horrific event that threatened our democracy on January 6, 2021. Our campus values make us most supportive of peaceful protest in support of varying points of view, but the mob behavior at our Capitol on January 6 was not a protest; it was a violent insurrection aimed at shredding our Constitution. Being a law and order nation means that we put laws above personal preferences. Of course, psychologists have long studied “group think” and mob behavior. As social creatures, humans are vulnerable to giving up personal agency and responsibility when swayed by persuasive emotional appeals and the sense that “everyone is thinking/behaving as I am.” Our world history is littered with evidence of the horrible things humans will do to each other when under the influence of ideologies, powerful leaders, and personal fears. As Voltaire famously said in his 1765 essay, Questions sur les Miracles, “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.” Time and time again, however, courts of law have not excused illegal behavior just because lots of others were doing the same thing. Akin, perhaps, to my Mother’s frequent questioning about whether I would jump off the Brooklyn Bridge just because my friends were jumping. Our U.S. system of law enforcement and courts will decide if those who breached our Capitol Building are guilty of crimes such as murder, robbery, vandalism, forcible entry, and more. Whatever the courts say, those people are not lovable patriots. They are misinformed, incited, white-supremacist, and violent souls who were not fighting for freedom. They were fighting to overturn the will of more than 80 million voters. Please let’s not normalize this event as being a protest or representing some spontaneous rage. A cornerstone of our democracy is the peaceful transfer of power. It’s understandable to be disappointed when a preferred candidate loses, but it’s illegal to threaten members of Congress for doing their Constitutional duty. It’s delusional not to accept the results of multiple investigations and court cases, including a U.S. Supreme Court decision, as to the veracity of results of the 2020 presidential election. I write today not to support a political position, but to urge us all to understand that our Constitution gives rights and responsibilities. Loving our nation means using Constitutional avenues to create social change. We will vote again for members of Congress in just two years. That will be consequential. We’ll vote again for a president in four years. That’s the way democracy works. Our democratic institutions and Constitution are not perfect. Obviously, the Constitution and many state and federal laws and procedures gravely harmed Black and African Americans over the course of our history. Building up our institutions and perfecting them to be truly inclusive is a task ahead of us. The other formidable task that must be accomplished is to build common ground among the American people. Our campus must play a significant role in being a model of equity. This is a work in progress to which I am committed. Our research and scholarship must also be a source of evidence and shaper of policies about issues of importance to all, for example, health, education, prosperity, racial justice, and community safety.

Our campus values make us most supportive of peaceful protest in support of varying points of view, but the mob behavior at our Capitol on January 6 was not a protest; it was a violent insurrection aimed at shredding our Constitution. Being a law and order nation means that we put laws above personal preferences. Of course, psychologists have long studied “group think” and mob behavior. As social creatures, humans are vulnerable to giving up personal agency and responsibility when swayed by persuasive emotional appeals and the sense that “everyone is thinking/behaving as I am.” Our world history is littered with evidence of the horrible things humans will do to each other when under the influence of ideologies, powerful leaders, and personal fears. As Voltaire famously said in his 1765 essay, Questions sur les Miracles, “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.” Time and time again, however, courts of law have not excused illegal behavior just because lots of others were doing the same thing. Akin, perhaps, to my Mother’s frequent questioning about whether I would jump off the Brooklyn Bridge just because my friends were jumping. Our U.S. system of law enforcement and courts will decide if those who breached our Capitol Building are guilty of crimes such as murder, robbery, vandalism, forcible entry, and more. Whatever the courts say, those people are not lovable patriots. They are misinformed, incited, white-supremacist, and violent souls who were not fighting for freedom. They were fighting to overturn the will of more than 80 million voters. Please let’s not normalize this event as being a protest or representing some spontaneous rage. A cornerstone of our democracy is the peaceful transfer of power. It’s understandable to be disappointed when a preferred candidate loses, but it’s illegal to threaten members of Congress for doing their Constitutional duty. It’s delusional not to accept the results of multiple investigations and court cases, including a U.S. Supreme Court decision, as to the veracity of results of the 2020 presidential election. I write today not to support a political position, but to urge us all to understand that our Constitution gives rights and responsibilities. Loving our nation means using Constitutional avenues to create social change. We will vote again for members of Congress in just two years. That will be consequential. We’ll vote again for a president in four years. That’s the way democracy works. Our democratic institutions and Constitution are not perfect. Obviously, the Constitution and many state and federal laws and procedures gravely harmed Black and African Americans over the course of our history. Building up our institutions and perfecting them to be truly inclusive is a task ahead of us. The other formidable task that must be accomplished is to build common ground among the American people. Our campus must play a significant role in being a model of equity. This is a work in progress to which I am committed. Our research and scholarship must also be a source of evidence and shaper of policies about issues of importance to all, for example, health, education, prosperity, racial justice, and community safety. Our teaching must be rigorous and lead to in-depth knowledge about forms of government with a special emphasis on our responsibilities as beneficiaries of living in a nation of laws. Let’s commit to 2021 as a year of illumination for ourselves and for our communities.

Faculty members and student services staff members supported special activities before and after the performance. Following the performance I evaluated whether or not it achieved that goal.

They further expressed a desire to find another performance vehicle to generate deep and much needed discussions about race and ethnicity. When approached again to support NWC as a centerpiece of campus conversations, I indicated that while the performance could certainly go on as planned, I would not replicate the financial campus support I’d made available last year and did not have faculty or staff interested in doing curriculum planning around the performance.

117,csu3,9/5/17,California State University,Dreamers Welcome and Wanted at The Beach,Message,Political CT,"Many of you know of the federal program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA). The policy has allowed eligible undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children to receive protection from deportation, an ability to travel internationally, and the potential to obtain a work permit that must be renewed every two years. Today, United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced President Trump’s decision to rescind DACA, requesting the Department of Homeland Security to begin to “wind down” the policy. His action means that the members of The Beach community who hold DACA status could soon lose the rights described above, and so face difficulties and uncertainty about their futures in the U.S. My heart goes out to these individuals and their families. As we learn more about this “wind down” process, we will share those details with you. It is important to note this process provides us a chance to communicate with our Congressional leaders to implore them to act swiftly to ensure our Dreamers’ security. Our undocumented community members, including DACA and AB540, are part of the Beach family and are welcome and wanted. Each is cherished and vital to our campus community. Because of this current uncertainty, I want to assure all members of our undocumented community that we have campus services available to you. A first stop should be our Dreamers Success Center at USU 309, www.csulb.edu/dream. There, you can be referred for counseling, food and housing support, and other services. The Division of Student Affairs and our Human Resources Department have a number of other areas where support and services are available. I also want to reduce any confusion that may result from this announcement. Long Beach State University is committed to every student who has met our rigorous standards for admission and retention; and we value every employee. Know that this announcement will not affect the AB540 status that the state of California has provided. Students currently eligible for AB540 will continue to be eligible for in-state tuition and the financial support for which they are qualified. In addition, Long Beach State University’s General Order 55 provides clear guidance to campus police officers. Our officers will not cooperate with ICE, and they will not inquire about or detain persons solely based on their immigration status. The change in national policy is disheartening. When signing up for DACA our students and colleagues believed the information they provided to the federal government would afford them an opportunity to work and learn free from fear of deportation. DACA has enabled our students to become even more productive and contributing members of our region.

118,csu4,6/9/18,California State University,President's Message,Message,Political CT,"The current “Zero Tolerance” policy used at our borders that separates children from their parents may be legal but it is neither moral, nor compassionate. Innocent children are being exposed to long lasting or even permanent threats to their positive mental and physical health. While reasonable debates may ensue about how to secure our borders, policies that harm children should not be in place. Decades of research in psychology and child development show that children need their parents – or excellent parent substitutes – to develop normally. Traumatic separations – even those for short periods – from parents (especially during the early years of life) can disrupt the all-important process of attachment between children and their parents. Successful attachment with parents predicts positive outcomes for children, including low anxiety, high trust, better health and more resilience. These children are more likely to become productive members of their community and whether that is in the United States or elsewhere, these outcomes affect all of us. Further, if reports are true that child detention caregivers are forbidden to hug or physically comfort young children, then separated children are facing additional danger. Research has shown, time and again, that young children must receive physical comfort from caring adults. Babies and toddlers cannot thrive without physical touch. Cal State Long Beach is home to dozens of experts in child development. Their research, and findings from experts around the world, confirms the cruelty of the Zero Tolerance policy. As just one example, we can look back with shame at policies that separated Native American children from their parents by sending the children to boarding schools. The death rates among children in those facilities was horrendously beyond the expected mortality rates for young children. Surely, we have become better than this as Americans. We are certainly a nation of laws, but we must aspire to be a nation that uses evidence to inform our laws and policies. I urge Congress to act on this and for the Trump administration to take immediate action to stop this policy – regardless of its legality.

119,csu5,12/5/14,California State University,Privilege at The Beach,Message,Political CT,"I’d like to do some thinking and talking about how to ensure The Beach is a zone of kindness and respect. A place of “automatic privilege plus meritorious privilege,” where we automatically accord one another expectations for the best and allow each person to earn additional privilege by purposeful work, persistence, and accomplishment. A place where privilege is unaffected by skin color, national origin, who we love, religion, or disability, veteran, or social status. Recent events remind me that this is not always the case in our society. Light skin color and high-income levels may attract significant unearned privilege. This privilege can manifest itself in numerous ways that afford automatic trust, deference, and security. Those who are less affluent with darker skin or from other cultures can be targets of micro to macro aggressions, distrust, and low expectations for behavior. Those with privilege are often unaware of this discrepancy, as people treat them with respect—as all individuals should be treated. When they enter department stores they are greeted with smiles and offers of help. When they ask questions or request additional service, they are answered cordially. On approach, they are seen as benign. Those without such privilege are thrown, merely by circumstances mainly out of their control, into the opposite context. They may be followed when entering a high-end department store or have their purchasing attempts viewed with suspicion. Others may view their presence or approach with suspicion and fear. While those who have privilege can see authority figures as benevolent and trustworthy, those without such privilege may experience these same individuals as threatening and abusive. These opposite perceptions can manifest in dramatically different behaviors. For example, when an officer of the law approaches me, I expect to be treated politely and so react to the approach calmly and perhaps with curiosity. My calm curiosity may be completely unimaginable to those without privilege. The insidious effects of low and high expectations concern me greatly. The research in behavioral psychology is pretty clear that we rise to higher expectations or become compliant and resigned to low expectations. Further, our expectations greatly affect how we make meaning out of situations. That is, if you think I’ll be cooperative and respectful, I am inspired to be just that. On the other hand, if you expect me to be defiant or scornful, I might adopt that attitude, or worse, have anything I do be perceived as such. My hope is that The Beach can be a national model that counters prevailing understandings of privilege—that through hard work and selfless contributions to the community, each of us can be successful and help others thrive.

120,csu6,8/21/20,California State University,"President Jane Close Conoley: This is our time in history to become even more resilient, excellent and inclusive.",Message,Social CT,I read an article a few months ago that called our passage to the coronavirus pandemic our time in history comparisons to disruptions caused by world wars other plagues social justice and civil rights action and previous economic collapses are easy to conjure and the phrase that this is our time in history has stayed with me since march i've continued to provide regular updates about the pandemic social justice racism and our budget situation and i'll continue to do so however for me another one of our important times in history began two years ago when i with many others across our campus and community began focusing on our future throughout but particularly now my inspiration has been how we ready ourselves to be creators of the university's future rather than victims of relentless change that surrounds us always today as i review what we debated wrote rewrote and made plans to do through beach 2030 i'm struck by how prescient we were we committed to cultivating resilience we accepted responsibility for the common good we pledged to be a student-ready university we proudly stated that teaching and learning are at the center of who we are we proclaimed that our diversity is the source of our strength as i look at this most recent leg of our journey since february our time in history i see that we were amazingly resilient in pivoting from a primarily in-person learning environment to an entirely and still mostly remote reality this not only illustrated resilience but proved the point that we are a compassionate and student-ready university our students faculty and staff could not safely be on our campus but yet we persisted in carrying out what we do best transformational teaching and learning gail bazer a faculty member in coda described her experience with remote teaching as a journey that started and i quote as an excess of lemons to some fabulous lemonade she and many others like her focus their creative talents on making their remote teaching highly engaging and effective for their students ted stankowicz a faculty member in cnsm has created a digital library collection from his mammal lab so that remote students can interact with this astonishing collection virtually and i know there are many others who embrace the challenge teaching and learning is at the center of what we do the methods of teaching are secondary to the mission of teaching during this time faculty won awards and published papers and students received state and national recognition in a number of areas research teams attracted national grants while everything seemed topsy-turvy we still persisted in doing the work that characterizes a great university for example the college of education was chosen to lead a three million dollar effort to eradicate equity gaps that have characterized u.s education forever and while many institutions are facing decreased enrollments we are still among the most applied to in the nation and are on track for a record enrollment above 39 000 students i'm pleased beyond mere words that we're slogging through our time in history with such exquisite style but what's next what are we doing to achieve the outcomes of our extensive beach 2030 planning work and do it with a special lens on equity and racial justice one commonality across many divisions and colleges was a desire to build more partnerships especially to support the public good our entire leadership team will now be engaged in launching a beach grand challenge infrastructure designed to leverage our intellectual capital to benefit our community and serve as a catalyst in la and orange counties we will link education and industry by embedding in the beach grand challenge faculty and student research applied learning and internships incentives for faculty interdisciplinary engagement and innovative on and off campus partnerships we'll also be tracking impacts on the local community we will also strengthen partnerships and collaborations with long beach unified school district lbcc the city of long beach and the port of long beach and other public and private entities to enhance student access to internships share expertise and resources to address housing transportation land use equity and sustainability challenges and we are also reviewing purchasing agreements to identify potential value-added purchasing opportunities to continue to operate efficiently last year i also gave voice to our need to have a growth strategy to buffer our finances from dips and state general funds state support will always be the vital cornerstone of our work but recent and historical realities illustrate why we must grow revenue streams by doing what we do best teaching and learning now more than ever californians need to finish degrees and upskill their repertoires so as to move into professional positions that secure a thriving lifestyle this aligns with increasing the size of our graduate programs some undergraduate programs and diversifying and expanding our portfolio of curricular offerings non-stateside to address the needs and strengths of our extended community of learners and the innovation force needs of our region i also know that the faculty roles and staff positions must evolve to offer support for an ever more diverse student body i want us to have opportunities for faculty to focus on research practice teaching and clinical

brings out the true character of an individual or community that's right but by and large accurate i think during this our time in history were we timid fearful indecisive and non-strategic i don't

Racial Justice,1/1/12,12/31/22,Public,Long Beach,CA,West,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",120,I read an article a few months ago that called our passage to the coronavirus pandemic our time in history comparisons to disruptions caused by world wars other plagues social justice and civil rights action and previous economic collapses are easy to conjure and the phrase that this is our time in history has stayed with me since march i've continued to provide regular updates about the pandemic social justice racism and our budget situation and i'll continue to do so however for me another one of our important times in history began two years ago when i with many others across our campus and community began focusing on our future throughout but particularly now my inspiration has been how we ready ourselves to be creators of the university's future rather than victims of relentless change that surrounds us always today as i review what we debated wrote rewrote and made plans to do through beach 2030 i'm struck by how prescient we were we committed to cultivating resilience we accepted responsibility for the common good we pledged to be a student-ready university we proudly stated that teaching and learning are at the center of who we are we proclaimed that our diversity is the source of our strength as i look at this most recent leg of our journey since february our time in history i see that we were amazingly resilient in pivoting from a primarily in-person learning environment to an entirely and still mostly remote reality this not only illustrated resilience but proved the point that we are a compassionate and student-ready university our students faculty and staff could not safely be on our campus but yet we persisted in carrying out what we do best transformational teaching and learning gail bazer a faculty member in coda described her experience with remote teaching as a journey that started and i quote as an excess of lemons to some fabulous lemonade she and many others like her focus their creative talents on making their remote teaching highly engaging and effective for their students ted stankowicz a faculty member in cnsm has created a digital library collection from his mammal lab so that remote students can interact with this astonishing collection virtually and i know there are many others who embrace the challenge teaching and learning is at the center of what we do the methods of teaching are secondary to the mission of teaching during this time faculty won awards and published papers and students received state and national recognition in a number of areas research teams attracted national grants while everything seemed topsy-turvy we still persisted in doing the work that characterizes a great university for example the college of education was chosen to lead a three million dollar effort to eradicate equity gaps that have characterized u.s education forever and while many institutions are facing decreased enrollments we are still among the most applied to in the nation and are on track for a record enrollment above 39 000 students i'm pleased beyond mere words that we're slogging through our time in history with such exquisite style but what's next what are we doing to achieve the outcomes of our extensive beach 2030 planning work and do it with a special lens on equity and racial justice one commonality across many divisions and colleges was a desire to build more partnerships especially to support the public good our entire leadership team will now be engaged in launching a beach grand challenge infrastructure designed to leverage our intellectual capital to benefit our community and serve as a catalyst in la and orange counties we will link education and industry by embedding in the beach grand challenge faculty and student research applied learning and internships incentives for faculty interdisciplinary engagement and innovative on and off campus partnerships we'll also be tracking impacts on the local community we will also strengthen partnerships and collaborations with long beach unified school district lbcc the city of long beach and the port of long beach and other public and private entities to enhance student access to internships share expertise and resources to address housing transportation land use equity and sustainability challenges and we are also reviewing purchasing agreements to identify potential value-added purchasing opportunities to continue to operate efficiently last year i also gave voice to our need to have a growth strategy to buffer our finances from dips and state general funds state support will always be the vital cornerstone of our work but recent and historical realities illustrate why we must grow revenue streams by doing what we do best teaching and learning now more than ever californians need to finish degrees and upskill their repertoires so as to move into professional positions that secure a thriving lifestyle this aligns with increasing the size of our graduate programs some undergraduate programs and diversifying and expanding our portfolio of curricular offerings non-stateside to address the needs and strengths of our extended community of learners and the innovation force needs of our region i also know that the faculty roles and staff positions must evolve to offer support for an ever more diverse student body i want us to have opportunities for faculty to focus on research practice teaching and clinical work and be rewarded for rigorous excellence in those areas increased diversity in how we deliver education will be the only way we can be student ready as the average age and life circumstances of our students continue to evolve we can't be just for 18 to 24 year olds with no

121,unc1,9/5/24,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,UNC chancellor: What I believe about freedom of expression on campus,Press,Political CT,"When 5,600 new students from all corners of our state and beyond gathered in the Smith Center for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s annual convocation to start the academic year, they had a lot on their minds. Many are living away from home and family for the first time and figuring out laundry and bus schedules. Some are questioning if they’ve chosen the right major. And nearly all will be wondering if these experiences are unique to them or just a rite of passage. As the recently hired chancellor at Carolina, I am also a first-year student of sorts. I am seeing this campus and its people with the same awe and anticipation as our incoming students. I, too, am making new friends, learning a routine, and looking forward to football games and fall leaves on Polk Place. But thinking about that rite of passage led me to consider what advice I might want, or need, as a first-year student. So, at convocation, I challenged my fellow Tar Heels to do three things: in their first month, get a meal or a cup of co!ee with someone from a di!erent city or state; in their first semester, attend a lecture or event outside of class; and in their first year, take a course that deepens their understanding of the world. This is how education happens — one experience at a time. While I was speaking directly to our new students, I think that’s exactly how all of us learn and grow — one experience, decision and connection at a time. One of our great strengths as a nation, state and university is a vibrant culture of robust and spirited debate. Civic engagement and peaceful protest have a long and noble history at Carolina. We have spent over 200 years questioning and deliberating how this purpose is put into practice, and that is still true for the most searing political and cultural conflicts of today. We don’t always get it right, but the purpose of a great public university, especially the nation’s first, is to provide a place where we can try repeatedly. Where ideas can be stated and challenged, weighed and evaluated. For that to work, everyone on campus must embrace the freedom to exchange these ideas without compromising the safety of our students and colleagues, and without disrupting the operations of the University and our ability to serve the public. At Carolina, every member of our community contributes to that culture by engaging with each other, by sharing and testing their views and by navigating complicated conversations about the great issues of the day. We know that friction and tension are inevitable when people who have di!erent experiences, ideas and viewpoints live and work together. But — on this I want to be clear — no one person’s freedom of expression is more important than another person’s right to teach, learn, discover, work or speak free from harassment and discrimination. No one has the right to disrupt campus operations, threaten or intimidate others or vandalize public property. Policies must and will be consistently applied to everyone, regardless of content or viewpoint, so that Carolina remains a steadfast supporter of free expression while fulfilling our mission of teaching, research and service to the state and society. We are a university and a nation in a time of great polarization about fundamental ideas of freedom, culture and democracy. There will be many opportunities this year to debate and demonstrate. We should welcome that dialogue as a sign of a healthy society, and a full education. But we should also expect, maybe even demand, that we engage with enthusiasm and respect for the principles of free expression that have been dear to this university for so many years. This Carolina tradition has shaped generations of Tar Heels who are serving across our state and around the world. Our newest students are joining that legacy of civic engagement and as they take their first steps toward graduation, we hope Carolina sets them on a path for a lifetime of mutual respect and connection.",https://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/article291918200.html,Lee Roberts,Male,1/12/24,237,Republican,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Israel-Hamas War & DEI,1/1/23,12/31/24,Public,Chapel Hill,NC,South,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",121,"When 5,600 new students from all corners of our state and beyond gathered in the Smith Center for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s annual convocation to start the academic year, they had a lot on their minds.

123,unc3,7/7/23,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,A message from Chancellor Guskiewicz: expanding access at Carolina,Message,Campus CT,"Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court held that universities across the country can no longer consider race when making admissions decisions, marking a fundamental change in the law that governs our admissions process, and that of thousands of other universities. We will follow the Supreme Court’s decision in all respects. That means race will not be a factor in admissions decisions at the University. It also means we will comply with the Court’s ruling that an applicant’s lived racial experience cannot be credited as “race for race’s sake,” but instead under some circumstances may illuminate an individual’s character and contributions. As we make these changes, we also will expand opportunity in continued service to the people of our state. First, Carolina will provide free tuition and required fees for incoming undergraduates from North Carolina whose families make less than $80,000 per year. Beginning with the incoming class in 2024, we will expand the University’s long-standing commitment to access and affordability for North Carolina families. This promise broadens that tradition established by successful and inspiring programs such as the Carolina Covenant and Blue Sky Scholars, among others. We want to make sure students know financial constraints should not stand in the way of their dreams. We will be sharing details about this exciting new opportunity within the next few weeks. Second, as part of our commitment to reach future Tar Heels throughout the state, we have hired additional outreach officers as part of our admissions team. They are serving in under-resourced communities to spread awareness of our affordability and recruit students from across the state. We want the best students to know that a UNC-Chapel Hill education is a possibility for them. Our responsibility to comply with the law does not mean we will abandon our fundamental values as a university. We are and will remain passionately public, and we will ensure that every student who earns admission to Carolina can come here and thrive. Our University’s commitment to access and affordability and supporting a culture of belonging for everyone does not change with last week’s ruling. In our 230-year history, our University has faced many changes. We have seen them as challenges but also opportunities to learn and grow, improving our capacity to serve the people of our state. As chancellor, a member of the faculty for 28 years and a parent of two recent graduates, I know our community creates strength from all our differences. We can’t lose different perspectives and experiences in the classroom that give depth to our discussions and make our work impactful.

The senseless acts of terror in Israel by Hamas are horrifying. I condemn this terrible violence and fear the cascade of events these attacks are provoking, both locally and globally. As I said in my University Day address yesterday, at Carolina we have focused on taking care of our community throughout the week. I’ve appreciated the powerful and emotional conversations I’ve had with students, faculty and staff. Their thoughts, concerns and experiences have informed our leadership team during this challenging time. Caring for their safety, especially with growing antisemitism across the globe, is our top priority. As I have emphasized on several occasions, there is no place for antisemitism or prejudice on our campus. Let me be clear – we will not stand for acts of violence on our campus. While we have a commitment to allow both internal and external groups to express their opinions under the First Amendment, we also strive to rise above hateful rhetoric and engage in civil discourse and educated debate. We should lead by example, in showing how people of different backgrounds and perspectives come together and truly listen and learn from each other in an environment where everyone feels safe and supported. I recognize that our Jewish and Muslim students, faculty, and staff are all affected by this violence in different ways. There are organizations on campus working to help us learn from and support each other, including NC Hillel, the Carolina Center for Jewish Studies, Chabad at UNC/Duke and the UNC Center for Middle East and Islamic Studies. We will continue the outreach to members of our community who are struggling and encourage people who need support to connect with resources at care.unc.edu. For support, students may contact Counseling and Psychological Services at 919-966-3658, the Dean of Students team at 919-966-4045, or Student Wellness at 919-962-9355. Faculty and staff may contact our Employee Assistance Program 24 hours a day at 877-314-5841. We always stand ready to support those in our community in need. I want to remind everyone that Carolina is a place where we strive to build our community together.

We know that every member of the Carolina community — students, faculty and staff — contributes to that culture by engaging with each other, sharing and testing their views and navigating complicated conversations about the great issues of the day. We also know that friction and tension are inevitable when people who have different experiences, ideas and viewpoints live and work together. As a nation, we have spent decades questioning and deliberating how best to put First Amendment rights into practice. The purpose of this great public University, the nation’s first, is to provide a forum where ideas can be stated and challenged, weighed and evaluated. For that to work, we must all have the freedom to exchange these ideas without compromising the safety of our fellow community members and disrupting the operations of the University. On this we want to be clear: No one person’s freedom of expression is more important than another person’s right to learn, work or speak free from harassment and discrimination. Civic engagement and peaceful protest have a long and noble history on our campus. No one has the right, however, to disrupt campus operations, threaten or abuse others or damage public property. Be assured that we will consistently apply our policies to everyone, regardless of content or viewpoint, so that Carolina remains a steadfast supporter of free speech while fulfilling our mission of teaching, research and service to the state and society. To ensure that the campus community is aware of our policies and resources around speech, when and how the University will express a point of view and options for organizing events and speakers, we encourage you to visit a new website that will be updated regularly. We welcome your input on how we can be as timely and transparent as possible with this information to ensure clarity during what we expect will be an active semester.

126,unc6,4/30/24,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,A message from University leaders on campus protests,Message,Campus CT,"We were disappointed that we had to take action this morning regarding protesters, including many who are not members of the Carolina community, who violated state law and University policies that provide for peaceful demonstration. Into the weekend, our University maintained a healthy and constructive dialogue with students and others who came to our campus to make their voices heard. This is our consistent tradition and practice, as the principle of free speech is enshrined in the North Carolina Constitution, which states that “freedom of speech and of the press are two of the great bulwarks of liberty and therefore shall never be restrained.” No one has the right to disrupt campus operations materially, nor to threaten or intimidate our students, nor to damage and destroy public property. Previous protests this year have concluded peacefully and without arrests. Policies have been shared with the entire campus on multiple occasions and with protest organizers at events. At several points during this past weekend, we had constructive conversations with organizers that allowed for the group to continue their event and remain within our reasonable time, manner and place policies. That changed Sunday evening when protestors backtracked on their commitment to comply with these policies. The leaders of this group ended our attempts at constructive dialogue. We must consider the physical safety of all of our students, faculty and staff. In addition, we are alarmed that we’re hearing more accounts of antisemitic speech, and we categorically denounce that and any other incidents of prejudice. Community members who feel they have experienced conduct that goes beyond free speech and is discrimination or harassment based on protected status, should contact the Equal Opportunity and Compliance Office at reportandresponse@unc.edu. The Class of 2024 had both their senior year of high school and their first year at Carolina severely disrupted by the pandemic.

Larry Jameson,Message,Political CT,"Late yesterday afternoon, a group of individuals led a series of protests that began at Temple University and traveled to Philadelphia City Hall and to Drexel University. At approximately 4:00 p.m., these protestors arrived on Locust Walk, joining with members of our Penn community. Penn’s Division of Public Safety, in partnership with local law enforcement, was informed of these pending demonstrations and worked to initiate safety plans in anticipation of the protestors arriving on our campus. Like many other colleges and universities across the country, Penn now has an encampment of protestors, with 10 tents currently on College Green. We are closely monitoring the encampment to ensure the safety of the Penn community and the protestors. Penn has and will continue to support the rights of our community members to protest peacefully and in keeping with University policy. At Penn, we will stand up for free speech and the productive exchange of ideas, even when we disagree. We will not stand by, however, if protected protest and speech deteriorate into words and actions that violate Penn’s policies, disrupt University business, or contribute to an intimidating or hostile environment on our campus. We are assessing the details of the protest through this lens and will take follow-up action as appropriate. Safety is, and will continue to be, our top priority, and there will be consequences for actions that are not permitted by University policies or local, state, or federal law. We recognize that this encampment may cause fear and anxiety by the very fact of it being on our campus. Please don’t hesitate to access Penn’s safety and wellness resources, which can be found here.

The University has made public statements denouncing acts of antisemitism on our campus and the terrorist attacks in Israel. Today, as Penn’s President, I want to speak directly and personally to all of you, to share my thoughts and to offer what I hope is some measure of clarity and comfort in this difficult time. I want to leave no doubt about where I stand. I, and this University, are horrified by and condemn Hamas’s terrorist assault on Israel and their violent atrocities against civilians. There is no justification—none—for these heinous attacks, which have consumed the region and are inciting violence in other parts of the world. I am heartbroken by the suffering of families and communities being ripped apart. Hostages are in peril. Thousands of lives have been taken, each a world lost. The war will take many more, with no end in sight. Here on campus and across our Penn community, people are hurting. They are angry and scared. They are thinking of loved ones and friends—constantly checking email and texts for news, terrified for those threatened by violence. These events, and the anxiety and uncertainty of the unknown that lies ahead, weigh heavily on us all. Penn will continue monitoring threats of violence here, in our city, and in other parts of the world. As part of our planning, Penn’s Division of Public Safety has further increased security and support for centers of Jewish life on and near campus. We will continue our outreach and support for faculty, students, and staff and will keep our entire community updated. At Penn, we are confronting these events in the wake of recent antisemitic acts on campus and individuals, with a public history of speaking out viciously against the Jewish people, appearing on campus as part of the Palestine Writes Literature Festival. Many have voiced their anger and frustration about this event. Please know that I hear you. I know how painful the presence of these speakers on Penn’s campus was for the Jewish community, especially during the holiest time of the Jewish year, and at a University deeply proud of its long history of being a welcoming place for Jewish people. The University did not, and emphatically does not, endorse these speakers or their views. While we did communicate, we should have moved faster to share our position strongly and more broadly with the Penn community. I stand, and Penn stands, emphatically against antisemitism. We have a moral responsibility—as an academic institution and a campus community—to combat antisemitism and to educate our community to recognize and reject hate. I look forward to continuing to work with Jewish leaders, faculty, students, and staff at Penn and elsewhere to ensure we are fostering a safe and inclusive environment. This is a hard moment in the world. Recent events on Penn’s campus make it that much harder. But at vigils held in front of the LOVE statue and across campus to honor and mourn innocent lives lost, I have seen people connecting and comforting one another. In all this anguish, there is hope.

129,upa3,11/3/23,University of Pennsylvania,President Liz Magill's Remarks at the Stated Meeting of the Trustees,Remarks,Campus CT,"For nearly 300 years — we are looking forward to our 268th Commencement in June — Penn has created knowledge, shared it for good, and educated the next generation. With everything I have, I believe in the power and importance of our mission. It must continue, and it will continue. But this is a dark and difficult time for the world. And it is a dark and difficult time for Penn. Many in our community have an immediate connection to the war – to Israel, to Gaza, to the region. So many lives have been taken or shattered, with families and communities ripped apart. Voices are being raised on all sides. We see some sharing light and reaching for unity. We see some sowing fear and stoking division. Antisemitism is resurgent in our society. There have been swastikas and hateful graffiti on our campus — here in our home. There have been chants at rallies, captured on video and widely circulated, that glorify the terrorist atrocities of Hamas, that celebrate and praise the slaughter and kidnapping of innocent people, and that question Israel’s very right to exist. There are other examples from other campuses, and there will be more. It is difficult to fully convey how sickened, and how horrified, and how angry I am. I condemn personally these hateful – hateful – antisemitic acts and words, which are nothing but inhumane. And I assure you that Penn has and will investigate any act of hate on our campus and take full action in accordance with our policies and our laws. The vibrant engagement of Jewish faculty, students, staff, and alumni has long been such an important part of who Penn is. To see their sense of belonging shaken by this hurt and fear — that is intolerable. I have sought to communicate these and other core beliefs clearly. I’ve heard from some that I have not been as effective as I could or should have been. This left room for doubt – doubt about my convictions, what our University believes, and how Penn moves forward from this. I regret that, and I am listening. Here is where I stand, and where Penn stands, and how we will move forward, together. We will continue to ensure the safety and security of our community, while safeguarding our ability to carry out our academic mission. We have and will investigate and pursue those who commit acts of hate, like the drawing of swastikas, that violate the law or our policies. We will not tolerate—and take immediate action against—any violence or incitement to violence. We have increased security across campus. Penn Police and Allied security are at every event, rally, protest, and vigil. We have strengthened security for Penn Hillel, the Katz Center, Lubavitch House, and spaces where our Muslim students worship at the Christian Association. We are ensuring students have access to safety escorts, mental health, wellness, and pastoral support. We will fight antisemitism and strive to be what I hope is one of many higher education leaders on how to address this urgent challenge. This campus cannot and will not be a comfortable or uncontested space for evil and hatred. On Wednesday, I announced an Action Plan to Combat Antisemitism, centering on three key areas: Safety and Security, Engagement, and Education. The Plan includes the creation of a new Task Force composed of faculty, student, staff, and alumni leaders, and our Penn Dental Dean Mark Wolff will be the Chair, for which I am deeply grateful. The interconnectedness of antisemitism and other forms of hate also demands our attention and action. I will soon convene and charge a Presidential Commission on these broad challenges, which will be chaired by Penn Engineering Dean Vijay Kumar and Penn GSE Dean Katharine Strunk. We will also defend the free exchange of ideas that is essential to our educational mission. Those in positions of leadership must not act as censors. Our duty is to ensure that our faculty and student scholars have freedom and security to pursue academic discourse unthreatened. At the same time, we will contest hateful views and repellant ideas on our campus. We can counter hate speech. And we will. That is what moral leadership demands. We will also strengthen the ties that connect us to one another. This is essential. Our Jewish community is afraid. Our Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian communities feel unseen and unheard. I condemn the death threats and doxing that many at Penn are experiencing based only on their identity, their affiliations, or their views of the suffering in this war. I am a President for all people in this community. We must find common ground on which to support and protect each other and this University. We must, together, bring our research, our teaching, our service missions to bear on urgent challenges. We must do this while advancing understanding aided by all the amazing resources of this extraordinary institution. That is why the actions I have outlined will be well-integrated with our strategic planning for the University’s future. I and Penn commit to these things. But I need help from every member of the Penn family. To move forward and to uphold our academic mission, we must stand together as a community. A community that condemns hate and finds ways to respectfully debate and talk across difference. A community that leads with care and compassion. I want and I welcome your insights, expertise, and partnership. For our alumni who have made clear their anger, pain, and disappointment, we need and want them, too. I hope, with time and progress on our goals, that they will once again engage with Penn. And I will work tirelessly to regain that trust. It is the honor of my lifetime to lead this amazing University. I am grateful for the strong support I have received from so many, including the Board of Trustees, and I am listening carefully and respectfully to those who want Penn to do better. I was lucky enough to have a great mentor, Justice Ginsburg. She said, “Fight for the things you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you.” Above all, I care about Penn, our people, and our noble missions. That’s what I’m fighting for, and it is my sincerest hope that, even when we disagree, everyone who loves Penn will join the effort.

130,upa4,9/22/23,University of Pennsylvania,A Message to the Penn Community,Message,Campus CT,"As many of you are aware, Penn Police responded yesterday to reports of an individual shouting antisemitic obscenities and overturning furniture at Penn Hillel. The individual was determined to be in crisis and was quickly and safely removed and referred for medical evaluation. This troubling incident came in the wake of another upsetting occurrence at the Weitzman School of Design, where a group of students found a swastika painted on the wall of a spray booth, a small room that is used for painting projects, on the fourth floor of Meyerson Hall. Dean Frederick Steiner wrote to the Weitzman community immediately after learning of the incident. The image was also quickly removed. Penn Police is actively investigating this incident and encourages anyone who may have information to please contact the Division of Public Safety at 215-573-3333. We unequivocally condemn such hateful acts. They are an assault on our values and mission as an institution and have no place at Penn. Sadly, incidents of hatred, including antisemitic rhetoric and acts that denigrate Jewish people, have become all too common. That these incidents happened on our campus, in our spaces, is deeply unsettling. We also acknowledge the timing of these incidents is particularly difficult given the controversial speakers who will be participating in the event on our campus over the coming days. It is our collective responsibility as a community to stand clearly and strongly against antisemitism. We are unwavering in our commitment to ensuring our Jewish community feels safe and supported on our campus. The Division of Public Safety is actively pursuing both incidents and following all protocols for potential bias incidents on campus. They are also continuing to provide increased security coverage and support to Penn Hillel, conducting special checks at Lubavitch House, and working to determine appropriate security measures for Jewish students living in on- and off-campus housing. We are also in active conversations with campus- and community-based organizations (an example is here) including Penn Hillel and the Office of the University Chaplain, and consulting the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism to guide our efforts to combat antisemitism on our campus broadly. Here are a few actions that are already underway: Training and education: We are reviewing and building upon our existing training and education programs to ensure we are including antisemitism awareness as part of our equity and inclusion programs for faculty, staff, and students. Community connection: We are redoubling our work with student organizations and other groups to encourage efforts to understand the interconnectedness of different forms of bigotry and oppression. We will continue working with the Office of the University Chaplain and the Division of University Life to bring people together to learn from and with one another. The University of Pennsylvania has a long and proud history of being a place for people from all backgrounds. Hateful acts like this sow fear and anxiety, and many members of our community are hurting right now. Please check in with your friends and colleagues and let them know that they are not alone. Offer your support. It is our collective responsibility to foster a campus environment where all members can thrive and succeed.

131,upa5,5/10/24,University of Pennsylvania,A Message on Ending the Encampment,Message,Political CT,"We have worked with serious intention for nearly two weeks to engage the protestors on College Green, who were notified on April 26th – the second day of the encampment – that they were in violation of Penn’s policies. This outreach has been met by unreasonable demands and a dangerous escalation of the encampment. Our community has been under threat and our campus disrupted for too long. Passion for a cause cannot supersede the safety and operations of our University. Early this morning, we took action, with support from local law enforcement, to remove the encampment. We would like to express our gratitude to the City of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Police Department for their support. This is an unfortunate but necessary step to prevent violence, restore operations, and return our campus to our community. Under these extraordinary circumstances, and to provide for the safety of our community, access to the College Green area of campus will be restricted until further notice. Those wishing to enter the area will be required to show a valid PennCard. Those without proper identification will be asked to leave and, if necessary, will be escorted off campus, or considered trespassing. The protestors refused repeatedly to disband the encampment, to produce identification, to stop threatening, loud, and discriminatory speech and behavior, and to comply with instructions from Penn administrators and Public Safety. Instead, they called for others to join them in escalating their disruptions and expanding their encampment, necessitating that we take action to protect the safety and rights of everyone in our community. We could not allow further disruption of our academic mission. We could not allow students to be prevented from accessing study spaces and resources, attending final exams, or participating in Commencement ceremonies, which for many did not happen during the pandemic. University leaders met with representatives of the encampment on multiple occasions, for extended periods of time. We hoped that reasonable conversations could address both the concerns of protestors and the needs of the University. We made clear that their proposals were not possible, including their demands that participating students and faculty receive amnesty without proceeding through our due process for conduct and for divestment from entities engaged with Israel. Penn remains unequivocally opposed to divestment, and it is unlawful for institutions receiving funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We also made clear that the encampment needed to disband and offered ways in which the protestors could continue their demonstration in compliance with our policies. We proposed, and still hope to deploy, Penn’s academic resources to support rebuilding and scholarly programs in Gaza, Israel, and other areas of the Middle East. Despite diligent efforts to find a path forward, the gap between the positions of many in the encampment and the University proved too wide to bridge in this volatile environment, while the risks to our community and our missions continued to increase. This decision is viewpoint neutral and affirmed by our policies. There are times when our abiding commitment to open expression requires balancing free speech with our responsibility to safety, security, and continuing the operations of the University. This is one of those times and why we have acted. Open expression and peaceful protest are welcome on our campus, but vandalism, trespassing, disruption, and threatening language and actions are not.",http://president.upenn.edu/announcements/ending-the-encampment,Larry Jameson,Male,12/12/23,150,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Israel-Hamas War & DEI,1/1/23,12/31/24,Private non-religious,Philadelphia,PA,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",131,"We have worked with serious intention for nearly two weeks to engage the protestors on College Green, who were notified on April 26th – the second day of the encampment – that they were in violation of Penn’s policies.

132,upa6,12/5/23,University of Pennsylvania,Testimony before U.S. House,Testimony,Political CT,"Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, and distinguished members of this Committee, for the opportunity to discuss the important issue of rising antisemitism in our society and the actions we are taking in response at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). My name is Elizabeth Magill. For just over a year, I have had the honor of serving as the 9th President of the University of Pennsylvania, a 283-year-old institution founded by Benjamin Franklin. Prior to joining Penn, I was Executive Vice President and Provost of the University of Virginia, the Dean of the Stanford Law School, and for many years a professor of law at the University of Virginia. Early in my career, I worked as a law clerk for J. Harvie Wilkinson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Let me begin by saying that I, and the University of Pennsylvania, are horrified by and condemn Hamas’s abhorrent terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th. There is no justification—none—for those heinous attacks. The loss of life and suffering that are occurring in Israel and Gaza during the ensuing war are heartbreaking. The pain extends to our campus. I know it from my daily conversations with our students, faculty, and staff, as well as parents and alumni. This hearing was called to discuss antisemitism on college campuses. I value this opportunity to reaffirm my and Penn’s unyielding opposition to antisemitism and to outline the urgent, university-wide actions we are taking to combat this centuries-old and resurgent threat. As President, my first priority is to members of the Penn community and, above all, to their safety and support. I must also ensure that our academic mission thrives; that academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas endure; and that we swiftly address any violation of the law or our University’s policies. These are the priorities Penn is seeking to achieve in the actions I will discuss today. Penn’s Relationship with the Jewish Community The vibrant engagement of Jewish faculty, students, staff, and alumni has long been an integral part of Penn. To see this sense of belonging shaken by recent events is deeply troubling. We trace our history back to 1772 with the enrollment of Penn’s first Jewish student, Moses Levy, who later became the first Jewish Trustee of the University. The Jewish Students’ Association at Penn was established in 1924. In 1970, Martin Meyerson became the first Jewish Ivy League 2 President. Since 2012, we have partnered with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute’s Visual History Archive to make available to students and researchers more than 50,000 video testimonials of Holocaust survivors and other witnesses. We—and I—are proud of our history and the prominent role our Jewish community plays in campus life and, broadly, in Penn’s academic excellence. Under my leadership, we will never shrink from our moral responsibility to combat antisemitism and educate others to recognize and reject hate. Addressing Antisemitism Prior to October 7th, antisemitism—a pernicious, viral evil—was already rising in our society, and global events have dramatically accelerated the surge. No place is immune, and campuses, including ours, have recently experienced an unacceptable number of antisemitic incidents. We are combatting this evil head on with immediate action. I have condemned antisemitism publicly, regularly, and in the strongest terms possible and today want to reiterate my and Penn’s commitment to combatting it. For decades our Division of Public Safety has learned from and worked with the Anti-Defamation League office in Philadelphia, and we are working closely with them, as well as local, state, and federal law enforcement to promptly report and investigate antisemitic acts against any member of the Penn community. Where we have been able to identify individuals who committed these acts in violation of existing University policy or law, we have initiated disciplinary proceedings and referred these matters to law enforcement where appropriate. We have also acted decisively to ensure safety throughout and near campus. We have expanded the presence of Penn Public Safety and Allied Security at our religious life centers including Penn Hillel, the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, and the Lubavitch House. We also enhanced security at every event, rally, protest, and vigil on campus. Penn Public Safety works in close collaboration with law enforcement, including the Philadelphia Police Department. Like many communities around the world, Penn has also experienced protests, rallies, and vigils related to the terrorist attack and the subsequent war. Protest—and all it entails—has long been a feature of university life. Penn’s approach to protest is guided by the U.S. Constitution, outlined in decades-old open expression policies, and supported and upheld by trained Open Expression Observers. We recognize the right of peaceful protest and assembly, and we give broad protection to free expression—even expression that is offensive. At the same time, we have zero tolerance for violence or speech intended to incite it. Our public safety officers are present at every protest, rally, or vigil, trained in de-escalation techniques, and, if necessary, they are ready to act. Protests playing out on campuses and in cities worldwide demonstrate the challenges of fostering robust debate during difficult times. In addition to respecting the right of protest, Penn is offering many ways for students to come together in classrooms and in small groups to discuss these issues. Making space for this sort of debate is in keeping with the best traditions and educational 3 missions of institutions like Penn. Educating citizens requires engagement with real-world challenges and hard topics—topics that often inspire passionate responses. University leadership must provide guardrails that encourage free and open expression while also ensuring a secure environment, and that is what I am seeking to do. These immediate actions are only the first step. I am also committed to lasting change and laying the foundation for a Penn that leads on these issues. On November 1, 2023, I announced Penn’s Action Plan to Combat Antisemitism, which builds on our anti-hate efforts to date and is anchored in the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. Developed in collaboration with faculty, staff, students, campus leaders, alumni, and national organizations like the American Jewish Committee, our Action Plan centers on three key areas: (1) Safety and Security, (2) Engagement, and (3) Education. In each of these areas, we announced both immediate and medium-term actions. As part of that Action Plan, I have convened and charged an Antisemitism Task Force, with membership across Penn’s schools and communities, to identify concrete, actionable recommendations. I have directed the Task Force to provide me with their recommendations in real time and to deliver their final report by this spring. We are making certain that all our educational efforts aimed at addressing bigotry include antisemitism and other forms of hate. To ensure our Jewish students have a direct channel to share their experiences with me, I have invited and received over 80 applications for membership to a new Student Advisory Group on the Jewish Student Experience. I also sent a delegation of university leaders to attend the Brandeis Leadership Symposium on Antisemitism in Higher Education. They have reported back to me and are already contributing best practices and lessons learned toward our efforts. As these efforts progress, I know we will have more to report. The Rise of Other Forms of Hate While I know this hearing is focused on antisemitism, we, and society broadly, are facing another significant challenge in this moment as well. We are seeing rising harassment, intimidation, doxing, and threats toward students, faculty, and staff based on their identity or perceived identity as Muslim, Palestinian, or Arab. Some have lost family members in this war, and many are worried about the safety of their loved ones in the region. Many are also afraid for their own safety, and the horrifying shooting of three Palestinian students in Vermont has only deepened their fears. I am appalled by and have publicly condemned these acts of harassment, threats, and intimidation. We are investigating all allegations, even when threats have come from outside our campus. We are providing resources and advice to assist individuals with online doxing, harassment, and threats. Safety and security for individuals and places of worship has been 4 increased across the board, and we are deploying all necessary resources to support any member of our community who is the target of hate. In addition to these immediate steps, I have created a Presidential Commission on Countering Hate and Building Community to empower our campus leaders to address antisemitism, Islamophobia, and hate in all forms, and to lay the groundwork for a stronger, more connected community. I will direct the Commission to provide me their recommended actions by spring. Changing Penn for the Better In challenging times, leaders must make many choices. The most important choice is to take the full measure of what we face, act decisively, communicate clearly, and lay the foundation for a stronger institution in the years to come. Our immediate actions—safety and support of our community, investigation and enforcement of policies and laws, and condemnation of hate—are essential. We will remain vigilant. We are also setting the stage for long-term change. I am committed to ensuring that Penn not only takes immediate action to combat antisemitism, but also creates lasting change and emerges as a higher education leader in this regard. Penn’s all-in efforts today, I believe, will bring about that better tomorrow. Closing Higher education institutions create knowledge, share it for good, and educate the next generation—missions that have never been more essential. Leading Penn is the honor of a lifetime because, even in these challenging times, we have never been stronger than we are today. Penn has attracted and is home to more-talented faculty, students, and staff than ever before. Each day, our faculty educate students while producing life-changing and award-winning insights and discoveries. Our health system provides world-class clinical care. Our students grow in their respective fields and go on to lead. If you visited Penn’s campus today, you would see vibrant university life. Students are walking to class and preparing for exams. Faculty are teaching seminars and undertaking research. Doctors, nurses, and health care providers are tending to thousands of patients. Dedicated staff are enabling the work of the University. You would also see many people engaged in serious and respectful conversation—despite disagreement—about difficult topics, including those related to the Israel-Hamas war. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the topic of this hearing, the disturbing rise of antisemitism. As the President of Penn, I join you—emphatically—in addressing these concerns and fostering solutions. That is why we are urgently taking both immediate and lasting action to make Penn an even better, stronger institution now and for the future. We must and we will stand together in unyielding opposition to antisemitism, hate in all its forms, and all forces that would seek to divide us. I look forward to your questions",https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/m._elizabeth_magill_university_of_pennsylvania_written_testimony_-_house_committee_on_education__the_workforce_-_12.05.2023_hearing.pdf,Liz Magill,Female,7/1/22,522,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Israel-Hamas War & DEI,1/1/23,12/31/24,Private non-religious,Philadelphia,PA,Northeast,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",132,"Thank you, Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, and distinguished members of this Committee, for the opportunity to discuss the important issue of rising antisemitism in our society and the actions we are taking in response at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). My name is Elizabeth Magill. For just over a year, I have had the honor of serving as the 9th President of the University of Pennsylvania, a 283-year-old institution founded by Benjamin Franklin. Prior to joining Penn, I was Executive Vice President and Provost of the University of Virginia, the Dean of the Stanford Law School, and for many years a professor of law at the University of Virginia. Early in my career, I worked as a law clerk for J. Harvie Wilkinson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Let me begin by saying that I, and the University of Pennsylvania, are horrified by and condemn Hamas’s abhorrent terrorist attack on Israel on October 7th. There is no justification—none—for those heinous attacks. The loss of life and suffering that are occurring in Israel and Gaza during the ensuing war are heartbreaking. The pain extends to our campus. I know it from my daily conversations with our students, faculty, and staff, as well as parents and alumni. This hearing was called to discuss antisemitism on college campuses. I value this opportunity to reaffirm my and Penn’s unyielding opposition to antisemitism and to outline the urgent, university-wide actions we are taking to combat this centuries-old and resurgent threat. As President, my first priority is to members of the Penn community and, above all, to their safety and support. I must also ensure that our academic mission thrives; that academic freedom and the free exchange of ideas endure; and that we swiftly address any violation of the law or our University’s policies. These are the priorities Penn is seeking to achieve in the actions I will discuss today. Penn’s Relationship with the Jewish Community The vibrant engagement of Jewish faculty, students, staff, and alumni has long been an integral part of Penn. To see this sense of belonging shaken by recent events is deeply troubling. We trace our history back to 1772 with the enrollment of Penn’s first Jewish student, Moses Levy, who later became the first Jewish Trustee of the University. The Jewish Students’ Association at Penn was established in 1924. In 1970, Martin Meyerson became the first Jewish Ivy League 2 President. Since 2012, we have partnered with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute’s Visual History Archive to make available to students and researchers more than 50,000 video testimonials of Holocaust survivors and other witnesses. We—and I—are proud of our history and the prominent role our Jewish community plays in campus life and, broadly, in Penn’s academic excellence. Under my leadership, we will never shrink from our moral responsibility to combat antisemitism and educate others to recognize and reject hate. Addressing Antisemitism Prior to October 7th, antisemitism—a pernicious, viral evil—was already rising in our society, and global events have dramatically accelerated the surge. No place is immune, and campuses, including ours, have recently experienced an unacceptable number of antisemitic incidents. We are combatting this evil head on with immediate action. I have condemned antisemitism publicly, regularly, and in the strongest terms possible and today want to reiterate my and Penn’s commitment to combatting it. For decades our Division of Public Safety has learned from and worked with the Anti-Defamation League office in Philadelphia, and we are working closely with them, as well as local, state, and federal law enforcement to promptly report and investigate antisemitic acts against any member of the Penn community. Where we have been able to identify individuals who committed these acts in violation of existing University policy or law, we have initiated disciplinary proceedings and referred these matters to law enforcement where appropriate. We have also acted decisively to ensure safety throughout and near campus. We have expanded the presence of Penn Public Safety and Allied Security at our religious life centers including Penn Hillel, the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, and the Lubavitch House. We also enhanced security at every event, rally, protest, and vigil on campus. Penn Public Safety works in close collaboration with law enforcement, including the Philadelphia Police Department. Like many communities around the world, Penn has also experienced protests, rallies, and vigils related to the terrorist attack and the subsequent war. Protest—and all it entails—has long been a feature of university life. Penn’s approach to protest is guided by the U.S. Constitution, outlined in decades-old open expression policies, and supported and upheld by trained Open Expression Observers. We recognize the right of peaceful protest and assembly, and we give broad protection to free expression—even expression that is offensive. At the same time, we have zero tolerance for violence or speech intended to incite it. Our public safety officers are present at every protest, rally, or vigil, trained in de-escalation techniques, and, if necessary, they are ready to act. Protests playing out on campuses and in cities worldwide demonstrate the challenges of fostering robust debate during difficult times. In addition to respecting the right of protest, Penn is offering many ways for students to come together in classrooms and in small groups to discuss these issues. Making space for this sort of debate is in keeping with the best traditions and educational 3 missions of institutions like Penn. Educating citizens requires engagement with real-world challenges and hard topics—topics that often inspire passionate responses. University leadership must provide guardrails that encourage free and open expression while also ensuring a secure environment, and that is what I am seeking to do. These immediate actions are only the first step. I am also committed to lasting change and laying the foundation for a Penn that leads on these issues. On November 1, 2023, I announced Penn’s Action Plan to Combat Antisemitism, which builds on our anti-hate efforts to date and is anchored in the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.

134,usc2,3/26/24,University of Southern California,State of the University Address 2024,Remarks,Campus CT,"I want to spend about five minutes just talking about what's up on the screen. I showed you this before, and all those things in red are the ones I consider particularly pertinent here. Not every school has the same issues. We're much more fortunate than many of our colleagues at many other universities, in part because of politics in our state give us different issues than they do in other states. In many other ways, also, because we're prepared for it. But thinking about global conflict and war, academic freedom, freedom of speech-I don't think we're in any doubt about academic freedom or freedom of speech here. But the conflict, the political polarization of campuses does affect all of us. We're not going back on DEIB. We don't have any legislators trying to tell us to do that. We follow the law, and we have the most diverse research university in America. I think we do things right there, and we will continue to do them. Workforce and unions-more money. I do really think that that's one of the issues-how can people be compensated in higher ed? We'll see more of that. And there's changes in student preferences, areas of study, things like that, that will all be a part. But where the government gets involved is when they try to make laws to regulate it. And you're seeing it and you're reading it all the time. You're seeing changes in admissions regulating that, taking away affirmative action, legacy-that's the next one. People are going for affordability in all these areas. There are laws in Sacramento and in D.C. almost every week. We've got amazing teams working on them and staying ahead. These are the areas where I think we have the most immediate concerns and needs. In particular, affordability. As long as we continue to be able to be eligible for federal grants-and we aren't doing anything that makes me think we would not be-we follow this very, very well. But graduate debt is the biggest issue the feds are taking on, and we're working really hard on that in our own schools. Athletic regulation, I could be here for the next week talking about that. And also other things like taxing endowments. That is not something that happens really on our endowment, because in spite of it being close to $8 billion, they look at it on a per capita basis. If you were to look at that, and we're not large at all, we're about 130 on a per capita basis. So this isn't our issue right now, even though you might be reading about it. In addition, we take a lot of action to get ahead of that work. We've been working hard to keep this to be a destination of choice. That's what I think you do all the time. We try to do things to really get ahead of financial pressures. We took action with respect to 2U, replacing external providers for online education with our own teams just in the last year. That's a big effort. Working on affordability, it's the thing I've worked on since the day I walked in. I'll be talking and working on affordability on the day I leave. It's really critically important. Our moonshots keep us ahead in what are arguably the most important areas in higher education right now. And we're working on our national and international competitiveness. Now, I know you know, we just put in the new USC in D.C. building. I think it's really important, and next time, we'll give you a lot more to talk about that. But that has really been going forward. We got a wonderful gift from one of our trustees, Leonard Schaeffer, to set up the Schaeffer Center there. People are filling it. We have more activities going there almost than in Bovard. It's really exciting, and it is keeping us on the page in all that D.C. legislation. This is so important. I'm not going to show the video of that, but I do think it's important to realize we're ahead there, and we have the most beautiful building of all. I hope as you work with Andrew and others about things you might like to do there, you'll find yourself going and visiting. I think it's a wonderful way for us to have that high visibility across the nation. The other one I wanted to mention is that USC has been ahead being an international university for years. One of the very first ones, back in the 1930s, to start going into Asia, and we have wonderful, incredible history with our Asian partners. We just made a big push into India. I think it's wonderful. I had an amazing visit there with 22 of our senior leaders and deans, all in three different cities in India, and we're very excited about all the things that future will be bringing to us. And it was especially good to be there when the ambassador is former Mayor Eric Garcetti. So very helpful for SC in D.C. I want to get to closing with a little bit of optimism for you because I think you should feel optimistic. You always read that everybody hates universities. But that is absolutely not true. You all know that there is bias in the way the question is asked. There is also bias in the moment in which that question is asked. And yet when you go out and you look at it, people still want to send their students. All the data shows still show that students that get college degrees are actually doing better financially in many ways. And then, in particular, when you ask them things about medicine, about research, about discovery, about building innovation, they all think American universities are the best in the world. It's important to remember that the complications do not encapsulate even the way people think and feel about the university. So this just shows you some data that go along with that. But I think it's important for all of us to really see that and think as we go forward. We've gotten where we were being big, fast, and connected, and it's my real belief that the world needs places like USC, even more than ever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n5XSSsPmsQ&t=37s,Carol Folt,Female,7/1/19,1730,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Israel-Hamas War & DEI,1/1/23,12/31/24,Private non-religious,Los Angeles,CA,West,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",134,"I want to spend about five minutes just talking about what's up on the screen.

135,usc3,8/20/24,University of Southern California,Welcome to a new year at USC,Message,Political CT,"We are excited to start a new academic year and welcome our new and returning students, faculty, staff, and alumni to campus. It’s a wonderful time to renew and create new relationships, explore something different, and set fresh goals. We have a very busy term ahead, with new academic programs, events around joining the Big Ten, marquee student performances, research breakthroughs, and so much more. We hope you had a refreshing summer and look forward to seeing you. Over the summer we tightened and expanded our rules and processes designed to ensure our campus is safe and welcoming for everyone. A list of links to this critical information is included below. One thing you’ll notice immediately is the improved process of accessing campus. We hope the new system will make it faster and easier. Last Spring’s Challenges: The events of last spring were particularly challenging for campuses nationwide. USC has seen peaceful protests, vigils, and marches for years, including more than 130 last year alone. However, the spring semester brought incidents that tested our values, disregarded our policies, sparked fears, and required unprecedented safety measures. While many in our community were not directly involved in the protests, we recognize the genuine pain and frustration driving them. This suffering and passion did not disappear over the summer. We hope by making our policies, guidelines, and rules clearer, we can make USC welcoming and safe for all, no matter what issues or conflicts arise. Free Expression and Academic Freedom: The ability to express oneself, to assert beliefs, and to dissent is fundamental to our university and our democracy. We each share a responsibility to foster an environment where divergent ideas can be discussed, examined, and challenged without infringing on others’ rights and safety. As we transition to the fall semester, we remain committed to ensuring your rights to free speech, academic freedom, and peaceful protest in accordance with state and federal law. We expect you to follow the university’s rules and policies designed to support your rights and prevent disruption of university functions. We also are required by law to maintain a safe and bias-free environment in our classrooms, hospitals, events, and campuses. These values are essential to the Trojan community and do not conflict with free speech or academic freedom. The links below explain free expression and academic freedom, along with legal responsibilities and limitations. Time, Place, and Manner Rules for Free Expression at USC: USC has long-standing rules, guided by federal and state law, to ensure that everyone can participate fully in a bias-free, free speech academic and on-campus residential environment. These “time, place, and manner” limitations balance your right to express yourselves with the university’s responsibility to ensure the rights of all. These include long-standing rules banning encampments, damaging property, blocking access to campus and classrooms, doxing, harassment, and bullying (online or in person), as well as clear guidelines for protests of all sorts. Over the summer, we reviewed and clarified these policies. You should become familiar with this material, and the Student Commitment which all students were required to read and acknowledge before enrolling. The university will continue to enforce these rules fairly, consistently, and expeditiously, acting quickly to protect campus health and safety. It always has been a Trojan Family value to be patient and respectful even in heated debates. By adhering to our highest standards, we will continue to maintain a culture of respect and dignity toward others. University Statements, Communication, and Accountability: Universities and their leaders often are asked to take sides on political, social, and moral issues. Yet, such statements can silence people, be seen as speaking for everyone, and lead to unintended consequences and seeming orthodoxies that stifle people’s rights of free speech. This runs counter to our responsibility to support viewpoint diversity, open and impartial debate, free speech, and safety in all aspects of university life. This understanding drove the Unifying Values written and adopted by the USC community in 2020, which include “fostering a community in which we solicit, embrace, and share diverse viewpoints.” In line with these ideas, going forward as individual leaders or on behalf of the university, we will not post statements or take sides in political or social debates unless it pertains directly to our institutional mission and operations. This posture, sometimes referred to as “institutional restraint or neutrality,” has been widely adopted by both public and private universities across America. Trojans Care for Trojans: Global conflicts, along with social and political unrest or transition, always prompt strong reactions and feelings at universities. We embrace our societal role and encourage Trojans to safely and freely express themselves. At the same time, we call on you to care for your fellow Trojans even if you strongly disagree on issues. Let’s embrace the expression “Trojans Care for Trojans.” By working together, we can create a university home for our Trojan Family that values differing opinions, cultivates open dialogue, supports one another, and seeks common ground in a complex world. We look forward to a great year with you.

136,usc4,10/31/23,University of Southern California,Update on Campus Hate Speech and New Government Actions Regarding Antisemitism and Islamophobia,Message,Political CT,"Over the past three weeks, we’ve been in conversation with many faculty, students, staff, alumni, and parents who have been personally and profoundly impacted by the violence in Israel and Gaza. Yesterday, the federal government announced new actions to address antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses. The White House, the Department of Education (DOE), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will be issuing formal guidelines. Here is what we know so far: The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) will be updating its discrimination complaint form to include language stating that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits antisemitism and Islamophobia and will expedite investigations of these complaints. DOE is also planning to hold technical assistance webinars to provide students with information on how to file an OCR complaint. The DOJ and DHS are dedicating 125 protective security advisers and 100 cybersecurity advisers to proactively work with schools and universities to address their needs for cyber threats and online harassment. The Justice Department’s Community Relations Service is also expanding support for Jewish, Muslim, Arab, and other impacted communities on campuses across the nation. The U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution denouncing antisemitism at institutions of higher education and encourages college and university leaders, as well as administrators, to voice their opposition to antisemitism on campus. At a time when antisemitism has accelerated across the country and around the world, our Jewish and Israeli communities have expressed concerns about the university’s protest and poster policies, and about the rhetoric they encounter on campus and online. Many are afraid for their safety. Reports of Islamophobia are increasing. Palestinian and Arab communities also have expressed fear about being doxed, threatened, targeted, and harassed online, and about being censored and canceled for their advocacy on campus. USC publicly and unequivocally denounces antisemitism, Islamophobia, racism, and xenophobia. Hate speech is antithetical to our values and any threats of violence are unacceptable. Anyone who incites violence will be referred immediately to law enforcement for investigation and prosecution. We have a dedicated page that outlines in detail USC’s policies on campus safety, including specific rules, procedures, support resources, and our values. We update this frequently and urge you to use it and refer others to it as needed. During this time of immense pain and intense polarization, it is more important than ever for us to model what civil disagreement and respectful debate looks like on campuses, in our classrooms, and online. Indeed, our university community can and should be a sanctuary for critical thinking and civic engagement so that we can all be part of the solution to the world’s most challenging problems. And so, we ask all members of our community to continue to see the humanity in each other, to recognize and respect each other’s value and dignity, and to treat each other as cherished members of a global Trojan Family.",https://www.president.usc.edu/2023/10/31/update-on-campus-hate-speech/,Carol Folt,Female,7/1/19,1583,Democrat,Democrat,Democrat,Republican,Democrat,Democrat,Israel-Hamas War & DEI,1/1/23,12/31/24,Private non-religious,Los Angeles,CA,West,"Large (>10,000 FTE)",136,"Over the past three weeks, we’ve been in conversation with many faculty, students, staff, alumni, and parents who have been personally and profoundly impacted by the violence in Israel and Gaza.

As your president, my responsibility is to uphold our Trojan values so that everyone who lives, learns, and works here can have safe places to live, learn, and speak. This week, Alumni Park became unsafe. No one wants to have people arrested on their campus. Ever. But, when long-standing safety policies are flagrantly violated, buildings vandalized, DPS directives repeatedly ignored, threatening language shouted, people assaulted, and access to critical academic buildings blocked, we must act immediately to protect our community. USC has long-standing protocols that allow for peaceful protesting, and we have been working successfully with our community to ensure these rules have been followed at gatherings, protests, and vigils taking place all year. USC also has firm rules regarding harassment and bullying that we will uphold. If you have a concern, please report it here. I assure you we will launch an inquiry and take action to protect all USC students, faculty, and staff – no matter their views. The current pressures and polarization have taken a toll in ways that break my heart. I know Trojans will do what they have always done: share points of view, listen, search for common ground – and find ways to support each other.

138,usc6,5/5/24,University of Southern California,Campus Update,Message,Political CT,"I am writing to let you know that early this morning DPS, with the assistance of the LAPD, removed the occupiers who had rebuilt their illegal encampment in Alumni Park. The operation was peaceful. Campus is opening, students are returning to prepare for finals, and commencement set-up is in full swing. Over the last few weeks, the university exercised patience and restraint as we worked to de-escalate a volatile situation. We’ve spoken to the occupiers daily, issued repeated warnings, and offered opportunities and locations for them to protest lawfully. We’ve supported their right to express strong opinions and passions for their cause, as always. Yet when free speech protests devolve into illegal occupations, violating the rights of others, we must draw a line. The occupiers repeatedly chose to ignore university policies designed to benefit everyone, and to break the law. We needed to act quickly to protect the rights of our 80,000 students, staff, and faculty. We are in the critical period from the end-of-term quiet study week, through finals and our commencement ceremonies. Despite our efforts to de-escalate, the occupation was spiraling in a dangerous direction over the last several days. Areas of campus were blocked, people walking down Trousdale, our main thoroughfare, were harassed, and iconic Trojan symbols were defaced. In addition, university property was stolen, and commencement structures were dismantled. Residence halls, campus throughfares, and libraries had become places of confrontation. Some finals were disrupted with noise and chanting during mandated quiet periods. Yesterday afternoon, outside agitators jumped the perimeter fencing and assaulted our officers. This had to stop. With no resolution in sight, I requested the LAPD to assist DPS in removing the encampment as peacefully and safely as possible. At 4:10 a.m., an order to disperse was issued, providing the trespassers one last opportunity to leave voluntarily. In 64 minutes, the encampment was abandoned and cleared. The operation was peaceful with no arrests. We will not tolerate illegal encampments of any kind at USC. Over the last week, we methodically and carefully executed on our strategy. My goals were to prioritize safety and return our campus and our surrounding community to normalcy. We were determined to ensure our students could finish their exams without further disruption and that USC could host the commencement celebrations our graduates have worked hard to earn. As I shared with the Trojan Family last Friday, freedom of speech is central to who we are as a university and is at the core of our democratic society. USC is home to 47,000 students with many different perspectives, and our policies are designed in a manner that allows people to express those opinions.

139,cla1,4/30/24,"University of California, Los Angeles",Affirming our Values in a Challenging Time,Message,Political CT,"This past Thursday, a group of demonstrators — both members of the UCLA community and others unaffiliated with our campus — established an unauthorized physical encampment on part of Royce Quad, joining those who have set up similar presences at universities around the country. Many of the demonstrators, as well as counter-demonstrators who have come to the area, have been peaceful in their activism. But the tactics of others have frankly been shocking and shameful. We have seen instances of violence completely at odds with our values as an institution dedicated to respect and mutual understanding. In other cases, students on their way to class have been physically blocked from accessing parts of the campus. UCLA supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid. These incidents have put many on our campus, especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear. In response, we have taken several immediate actions. We have significantly increased our security presence in the area, including adding greater numbers of law enforcement officers, safety personnel and student affairs mitigators.

Many of the demonstrators, as well as counter-demonstrators who have come to the area, have been peaceful in their activism. But the tactics of others have frankly been shocking and shameful. We have seen instances of violence completely at odds with our values as an institution dedicated to respect and mutual understanding. In other cases, students on their way to class have been physically blocked from accessing parts of the campus. UCLA supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid. These incidents have put many on our campus, especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear. In response, we have taken several immediate actions. We have significantly increased our security presence in the area, including adding greater numbers of law enforcement officers, safety personnel and student affairs mitigators. We have also engaged law enforcement to investigate the recent acts of violence. The barriers that demonstrators used to block access to buildings have been removed, and we have staff located around Royce Quad to help ensure that they will not go up again.

140,cla2,5/23/24,"University of California, Los Angeles","WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF DR. GENE DAVID BLOCK CHANCELLOR, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES MAY 23, 2024 HEARING BEFORE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES",Testimony,Political CT,"Good morning. Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member Scott, and members of the Committee, my name is Gene Block and I am the Chancellor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Thank you for inviting me here today. Let me start by affirming that all forms of discrimination, including antisemitism and Islamophobia, are antithetical to UCLA’s values and corrosive to our culture. We also take seriously our obligation to provide a safe and secure environment for our community. I wish I could say our campus has been immune to the disturbing rise of antisemitism that has occurred across our country since the horrific attack on Israel of October 7th. Sadly, it’s not the case. What I can say, and what I look forward to addressing today, is how we have been confronting— and will continue to confront—this challenge. Last summer, I announced my intent to retire this July after leading UCLA for 17 years. These are my final months as Chancellor of this distinguished institution. While I am saddened by the recent turmoil on our campus, I’m also proud of our legacy as a university deeply committed to the peaceful expression of differing viewpoints. It is my sincere belief that we cannot have a functioning democracy if we are unable to speak freely about the most consequential events of the day. As a public university, UCLA is subject to a dual legal mandate: we have a legal obligation under the First Amendment to protect free speech on campus, as well as a legal obligation under federal law to protect students from discrimination and harassment. This balance is not always easy to achieve. And it has been especially difficult since October 7th. I am fully aware that many of our Jewish students have had to confront rhetoric and images on campus that any reasonable person would find repugnant. Trust me, I understand their pain. I’ve lived it myself. …As a Jewish kid growing up in the Catskills region of New York, in a family with relatives who were Holocaust victims and survivors. …As the former provost of the University of Virginia, watching neo-Nazis riot outside the synagogue where my children were called to the Torah. …As the chancellor of UCLA where an art show depicted me with exaggerated facial features that was reminiscent of caricatures of Jews during the Nazi era. As we all know, being an American means sometimes being asked to tolerate offensive and even hateful speech protected by our Constitution. But there are limits. At UCLA, we draw the line when speech crosses into intimidation, threats, and harassment of others. UCLA has a long and proud history of peaceful protest and demonstration. Before October 7th, we had successfully employed de-escalation strategies recommended by the University of California to address campus protests. But on April 25th, as conflict spread on universities across the country, a protest sprang up in the center of our campus, testing the limits of our traditional approach. We followed University of California systemwide policy guidance that directs all ten UC campuses not to use law enforcement to remove protesters unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the physical safety of the community. Accordingly, the encampment was allowed to remain. As the encampment grew to more than 500 protesters, some of whom were not even affiliated with UCLA, it disrupted normal access to some classes, which impeded our educational mission. On April 28th, I decided to remove the encampment after violence broke out between opposing rallies and I asked for a security plan to safely do so. Two days later, we gave the protesters written notice that the encampment was an unlawful assembly and that we would remove it if the protesters did not disperse. But before the necessary police resources could be assembled to remove the encampment, which had become a focal point of conflict, assailants attacked the encampment that evening. Tragically, it took several hours before law enforcement could quell the violence. With the support of the University of California’s President Michael Drake, we provided protesters a final opportunity to leave that next day. But, when more than 200 protesters refused police orders to leave, law enforcement removed the encampment that night. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk. We have taken decisive action in the wake of these events to maintain safety across campus. I created a new Office of Campus Safety that reports directly to me. Under this new unit, UCLA is conducting a thorough examination of our security processes. Additionally, an independent police consultant has initiated a review of the confrontation, including our planning and security protocols. Finally, we will hold accountable those who engaged in violence and violated our policies. No student should be threatened or excluded based on their beliefs or their identity. While we always strive to meet this obligation, we must also maintain our commitment to academic freedom and free speech. This balance is central to UCLA’s educational mission. It is not always easy to strike a perfect balance, but it must always be our goal.

141,cla3,5/2/24,"University of California, Los Angeles",Our Community is in Deep Pain,Message,Political CT,"Our community is in deep pain. We are reeling from days of violence and division. And we hope with all our hearts that we can return to a place where our students, faculty and staff feel safe and, one day, connected again. Our approach to the encampment that was established on Royce Quad last week has been guided by several equally important principles: the need to support the safety and wellbeing of Bruins, the need to support the free expression rights of our community, and the need to minimize disruption to our teaching and learning mission. The events of the past several days, and especially the terrifying attack on our students, faculty and staff on Tuesday night, have challenged our efforts to live up to these principles and taken an immense toll on our community. We approached the encampment with the goal of maximizing our community members’ ability to make their voices heard on an urgent global issue. We had allowed it to remain in place so long as it did not jeopardize Bruins’ safety or harm our ability to carry out our mission. But while many of the protesters at the encampment remained peaceful, ultimately, the site became a focal point for serious violence as well as a huge disruption to our campus. Several days of violent clashes between demonstrators and counter-demonstrators put too many Bruins in harm’s way and created an environment that was completely unsafe for learning. Demonstrators directly interfered with instruction by blocking students’ pathways to classrooms. Indirectly, violence related to the encampment led to the closure of academic buildings and the cancellation of classes. And frankly, hostilities were only continuing to escalate. In the end, the encampment on Royce Quad was both unlawful and a breach of policy. It led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission. It needed to come to an end. Over the past several days, we communicated with and made a formal request to meet with demonstration leaders to discuss options for a peaceful and voluntary disbanding of the encampment. Unfortunately, that meeting did not lead to an agreement. To preserve campus safety and the continuity of our mission, early this morning, we made the decision to direct UCPD and outside law enforcement officers to enter and clear the encampment. Officers followed a plan that had been carefully developed to protect the safety of protesters at the site. Those who remained encamped last night were given several warnings and were offered the opportunity to leave peacefully with their belongings before officers entered the area. Ultimately, about 300 protesters voluntarily left, while more than 200 resisted orders to disperse and were arrested. UCLA facilities teams are now in the process of taking down structures and cleaning up the quad, and we ask that students, staff and faculty continue to avoid the area. I want to be clear that we fully support the right of our community members to protest peacefully, and there are longstanding and robust processes in place that allow students, faculty and staff to gather and demonstrate in ways that do not violate the law or our policies. I urge Bruins to take advantage of these many opportunities, which were designed to support advocacy that does not jeopardize community safety or disrupt the functioning of the university. I also want to recognize the significance of the issues behind the demonstrators’ advocacy. The loss of life in Gaza has been truly devastating, and my administration has and will continue to connect with student and faculty leaders advocating for Palestinian rights to engage in discussions that are grounded in listening, learning and mutual respect. Similarly, we will continue to support our Jewish students and employees who are reeling from the trauma of the brutal Oct. 7 attacks and a painful spike in antisemitism worldwide. We will also continue to investigate the violent incidents of the past several days, especially Tuesday night’s horrific attack by a mob of instigators. When physical violence broke out that night, leadership immediately directed our UCPD police chief to call for the support of outside law enforcement, medical teams and the fire department to help us quell the violence. We are carefully examining our security processes that night and I am grateful to President Drake for also calling for an investigation. The past week has been among the most painful periods our UCLA community has ever experienced. It has fractured our sense of togetherness and frayed our bonds of trust, and will surely leave a scar on the campus.

143,cla5,10/13/23,"University of California, Los Angeles",Reflections at the Close of a Difficult Week,Message,Political CT,"I write to share reflections at the end of a very challenging week for both our UCLA community and the world. Only six days ago, a heinous assault was perpetrated upon Israeli civilians by the terror organization Hamas, a despicable attack that included the killing of children and the elderly as well as the taking of innocent hostages. Earlier this week, I joined UC leadership in condemning this attack, and as new details have emerged, I can only denounce it further: This was a grievous act of malice and hate. It was, I am pained to say, the largest one-day killing of Jews since the end of the Holocaust. Since then, Israel has responded to the assault, leading to a significant loss of Palestinian lives and the troubling displacement of large numbers of innocent individuals. Bruins have ties to both Israel and Palestine that run very deep, and while this conflict is physically far away, it is emotionally very close. Our community is experiencing trauma and heartache, outrage and anxiety. I reiterate my hope that students in need of support will reach out to UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services or the RISE Center. For those who feel the situation is impacting their well-being or academic life, support is also available through the Dean of Students office and Case Management. Many of our staff and faculty are strongly affected by this violence as well. Those who need support should connect with the Staff and Faculty Counseling Center. I urge supervisors to be flexible and understanding with employees during this time. This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. We must not devolve into violating one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911. As we enter the weekend, we should pause to look back on this difficult week, honor the innocent lives lost, and express our high hopes for a peaceful resolution to the current violence. We should also remember that a university is a diverse group of individuals united in their dedication to the pursuit of knowledge. We must model respect and endeavor to understand rather than alienate one another.

This week, the growing war has prompted lectures, rallies, protests, counter-protests and many intense debates on our campus. This will surely continue in the days to come, and we will stand firmly in support of our community members’ First Amendment rights to free expression. I only urge Bruins to remember that passion must coexist with compassion. We should debate ideas, but we must never attack one another’s fundamental humanity. We must not devolve into violating one another’s rights or jeopardizing one another’s physical safety. Anyone experiencing harassment should report it through our Office of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion. If you feel unsafe or threatened, immediately contact UCPD or call 911. As we enter the weekend, we should pause to look back on this difficult week, honor the innocent lives lost, and express our high hopes for a peaceful resolution to the current violence. We should also remember that a university is a diverse group of individuals united in their dedication to the pursuit of knowledge. We must model respect and endeavor to understand rather than alienate one another.

144,cla6,6/6/24,"University of California, Los Angeles",Looking Back on a Year Marked by Challenge and Achievement,Message,Political CT,"As the 2023–24 academic year draws to a close, students prepare for final exams and we wrap up planning for our commencement ceremonies, I wanted to pause to express my profound gratitude for the UCLA community’s resilience and dedication over the course of a year filled with both significant challenges and important achievements. I recognize that the challenges are probably foremost in our minds. Nearly our entire academic year has been set against the backdrop of war in Gaza, which — while troubling in its own right — has also unfortunately sown division and strife here on campus. Much of our community has engaged with this complex topic peacefully, but we have also seen political advocacy devolve into discrimination and harassment. Frustratingly, in some cases, disagreement has even led to outright violence (which continues to be actively investigated). The war’s impact on our campus reached a crescendo in the last six weeks, and this period now looms large in UCLA’s collective consciousness. I do not wish to downplay the anxiety people continue to feel, or the significant healing that we will need to do. I do believe, though, that it is important to remember that our university, our community and this academic year are not defined solely by our current, difficult chapter. In fact, looking back, this year was also marked by incredible achievement. During the 2023–24 academic year, our university inaugurated a new performance space, the UCLA Nimoy Theater; incorporated into our health system a new hospital serving the San Fernando Valley; and established the game-changing UCLA Research Park — where, among other things, we will work to fight cancer and autoimmune, neurological and cardiovascular diseases. We announced a transformational gift to the Institute of American Cultures to advance our ethnic studies centers, launched the first Disabilities Studies major in the UC system, and further developed our Dialogue across Difference initiative to help us work through conflict in humane and compassionate ways. Reflecting our trademark excellence, Bruins took home honors including the National Medal of Science, National Book Award, two MacArthur ‘genius’ grants, and two NCAA championship trophies in women’s water polo and men’s volleyball. And as we look to the future, we are grateful to be guided by a campuswide strategic plan — launched last fall — that promises to shepherd the university into a new era of innovation and inclusive excellence. Though we surely face turbulent times, these are still things we should celebrate. We should also acknowledge that all of our students, faculty and staff have displayed immense strength and fortitude this year, continuing their work and studies amidst substantial change and upheaval. The final few days of spring are a period of excitement and anticipation as we prepare to send off a new class of UCLA graduates. Reaching this milestone is a significant accomplishment at any time, but it is especially meaningful for many of this year’s undergraduates, whose senior year of high school was disrupted by the pandemic and who were not able to participate in their schools’ typical graduation ceremonies. I am happy to confirm that UCLA will honor students’ achievements with our regular in-person commencement events this year, and I urge graduates to visit our commencement website for details and updates. As I near the end of my time as UCLA’s chancellor — a role that remains the greatest honor of my professional life — I am filled with many emotions, but above all an overwhelming gratitude for every person who has made the UCLA community so special. So in closing, I want to simply offer you my thanks. Thank you for your dedication, creativity, resolve and commitment to excellence. Thank you for the compassion, respect and support you have shown one another. Thank you for carrying out our university’s important mission, and thank you for representing the very best of public higher education.
